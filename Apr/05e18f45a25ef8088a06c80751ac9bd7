Pilgrims with a banner that says Pope Francis one of us attend mass during the Vatican s celebration of young people. EPAVATICAN CITY. Happiness is not an app you can download on your mobile phone, Pope Francis told thousands of teenagers yesterday at a mass to mark a weekend dedicated to youth. Freedom is not always about doing what you want. In fact it is the gift of being able to choose the right way, he said in a homily punctuated by regular bursts of applause from the crowd on a packed St Peter s Square. Your happiness has no price. It cannot be bought and sold: it is not an application you download on a mobile phone. Even the latest version cannot help you to grow and become free in love. An estimated 70,000 teenagers were in Rome for a weekend of events to celebrate Francis s Jubilee year dedicated to the theme of mercy.In a surprise move on Saturday, the 79-year-old pontiff heard confessions from 16 of them and a video message from him was broadcast at a rock and rap concert in the Stadio Olimpico.One of the teenagers chosen to confess to the leader of the world s 1.2 billion Catholics said she had been trembling as she approached the chair on which the pope was sitting in St Peter s Square. But as soon as I sat down I had the feeling of being next to a normal person rather than the pope. Pope Francis is really one of us, Anna Taibi (15), told La Repubblica newspaper.The Sicilian teenager said she had been touched by Pope Francis s tenderness as he listened to her confession. I expected him to give me a penance &#8230; instead he absolved me and let me go. The importance of mobile phones to contemporary teenagers was also reflected in the Pope s message to the concert.Clutching an iPhone, he told his audience that living without Jesus was like not having any signal. Always be sure to go where there is a network: family, parish, school, he said. AFP/HR.
