South African President Jacob ZumaCAPE TOWN. The ANC has said it will rule until Jesus comes, but for a large part of the #ZumaMustFall march in Cape Town, it seemed Jesus should come sooner to get President Jacob Zuma to resign. Following the success of last year s #ZumaMustFall march, which many derided for being a long walk to a picnic, around 2 000 people marched through the city s CBD on the 22nd anniversary of Freedom Day to call for the president to either resign or be recalled by the ANC.The front ranks were filled with people carrying posters saying SA needs Jesus , a banner saying The blood of the Lamb and All things rise and fall on leaders while they sang Christian worship songs arranged to Soca music.The rear guard was more direct, chanting Zuma must fall and carrying posters with that call printed in huge letters.Another read, To our ANC leaders: There comes a time when inaction makes you guilty that time is now! Please recall Mr Jacob Zuma while another was more brief: Zoom Zoom must go .Richard Verreynne, chairperson of the Evangelical Alliance of SA, started the speeches outside parliament by running through complaints about President Zuma from the recent Constitutional Court finding, to the high unemployment rate in the country. He is a president of impunity, he said to cheers. We have become a country in permanent crisis. Another supporter of the call, Brutus Malada, said, Stand up and protect the future of this country. If this government, if this ANC, cannot act against Jacob Zuma today, you must be worried as South Africans. News24.
