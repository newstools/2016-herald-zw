We trained the lecturers and the students and now we are now providing the machines and equipment What we want to see is for the students here to run their own businesses in future. So for this project we have developed a shoe line which is not expensive, so that we push the volumes so that we consistently get orders from them, he added.Kaguvi would be focusing on low priced articles ranging from $4,95 to $5, 95.The equipment donated has a capacity to manufacture at least 3000 pair of shoes monthly.Kaguvi Vocational Training Centre principal, Villie Makonye welcomed the partnership.&nbsp;
