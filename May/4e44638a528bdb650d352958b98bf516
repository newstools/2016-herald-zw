LONDON. Steve Bruce insists Hull City will be motivated by glory rather than greed when they face Sheffield Wednesday for the lucrative prize of promotion to the English Premier League in today s Championship play-off final. With television revenue for English Premier League soccer clubs due to increase next season, the winner of the second-tier showdown at Wembley will land a record cash windfall to go along with their place in the top flight.Wednesday would earn at least 170 million from promotion and that figure could rise to 290 million if they avoid relegation.Hull can also expect a huge revenue boost if they triumph, although the value to them is less, at 110 million, as they will have to forgo parachute payments pending following their relegation from the Premier League last year.But Hull boss Bruce isn t worried about trying to improve the club s bank balance because he knows his players are solely focused on achieving a promotion that will allow them to face the country s best on the biggest stage.
