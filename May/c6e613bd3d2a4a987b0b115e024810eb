Later a number of companies, among them the National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ), Zimbabwe Iron and Steel Company (ZISCO), Hwange Colliery Company and Net-One, won the coveted award.The Rural Electrification Fund (REF) is implementing the Single Wire Earth Return (SWER) technology in all the rural provinces of Zimbabwe to innovatively accelerate the rate of providing access to energy to the rural areas of Zimbabwe.Swer technology is cheap, fast to implement and suitable in rural areas. Unlike the conventional grid systems, the technology uses one wire and fewer transmission poles and other accessories making it cheaper than the three phase systems.The SWER pilot project was constructed in Mudzi district of Mashonaland East province stretching for 35 kilometres.All the rural provinces are implementing the technology and in Mashonaland Central province, the SWER technology in Mbire district is complete and will be commissioned by the Minister of Energy and Power Development, Dr Samuel Undenge soon.
