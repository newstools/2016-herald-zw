Let s remember that these are assignments we get assigned to work on. This can change at any time, VP Mnangagwa said.The VP said he was impressed with the work being done at Arda Jotsholo Estate which is under wheat.Cde Mnangagwa s sentiments on wayward party members came after the party s Secretary for Finance, Cde Obert Mpofu, said he was the fourth in command in zanu-pf s hierarchy. zanu-pf is very procedural and regimental; we follow procedures. We re lucky to be under President Mugabe s leadership who is also First Secretary in zanu-pf. He is assisted by our Second Secretaries VP Mnangagwa and VP Phelekezela Mphoko, then comes the Secretary for Administration, Cde Ignatius Chombo and myself as the Secretary for Finance I m the fourth in command. This is not a minor achievement being number four in over 14 million people. When I m close to these leaders it makes me think that one day I will reach them, said Cde Mpofu.He said those tussling for positions should stop it and follow the party line.Cde Mpofu hailed VP Mnangagwa for not being involved in the quarrels within zanu-pf saying this has distinguished him from others.
