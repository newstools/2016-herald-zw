Bulawayo Bureau ABOUT 20 Cabinet ministers descend on Bulawayo today for the crucial Zim-Asset interactive conference that will be headlined by the First Lady Cde Grace Mugabe. The conference will be held at the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair s Hall 3 today and tomorrow under the theme: Consolidating Bulawayo s growth through Zim-Asset. Ministers are expected to explain how the city is benefiting from Government programmes.The Minister of State for Bulawayo Provincial Affairs, Cde Eunice Nomthandazo Moyo, yesterday said that 20 Ministers will grace the indaba, with the First Lady as the guest of honour.She said Cde Mugabe is also expected to handover a donation today at Mpopoma High School on behalf of Zinara. Everything is on course. We re putting the final touches and I can assure you that it will be a successful conference. Initially we were expecting 17 ministers but 20 have confirmed their attendance. We re also expecting the number of guests to rise from 600 to 800 because of the excitement and the positive response that we re receiving from the people of Bulawayo, said Cde Moyo last night.She expressed gratitude to various sponsors that made it easy for organisers to plan for the event. I m sure we all know that the Government doesn t have money and it s difficult to organise such events without assistance from well-wishers. I want to thank companies, churches, farmers and individuals who assisted us in organising this event. I m really proud of the excitement that the people of Bulawayo have about this event, said the minister.She emphasised on punctuality, saying it was important for the people to be seated by 8.45AM. Accreditation and registration will be done between 8AM and 8.45AM, said Cde Moyo.She said the conference was organised after it was realised that Bulawayo residents rarely get a platform to engage Government officials.She said this has deprived residents first-hand information on the Government s programmes and policies.
