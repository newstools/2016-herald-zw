Bulawayo Bureau VICE PRESIDENT Phelekezela Mphoko yesterday consoled the family of the late Zanu-PF National Consultative Assembly member, Cde Phineas Pondai Muchena, in Bulawayo. Cde Muchena, who died on Friday last week following a short illness, will be buried today at the Bulawayo Provincial Heroes Acre. VP Mphoko described Cde Muchena as a dedicated cadre. I am here to pay my condolences to Cde Muchena s family. As human beings we ought to understand that it was God s will and what He did is beyond our control, but all the same we need to continue pinning our hopes on Him. I have known Cde Muchena since the days of the struggle for independence and he played a key role in liberating the country from colonialism, said VP Mphoko. What pains me most is that the last time I spoke to Cde Muchena three weeks ago, we promised to meet, but due to other commitments on my part we couldn t. He was a true hero and because of his works he is going to be buried at the provincial shrine. Born on February 15, 1932 in Muchena village in Mutare district, Cde Muchena started his political career in 1957 when he joined the then African National Council under the leadership of the late VP Joshua Mqabuko Nkomo.He played a major role in the ANC youth wing and participated in the mobilisation of youths to take up the arms against the Rhodesian government.In 1960 when the ANC collapsed and was replaced by the National Democratic Party, Cde Muchena was elected the party s youth chair for Mayihlome district until the party was banned a year later.When Zapu was formed in 1961, Cde Muchena continued to hold the same post.In 1963, he was arrested and detained for mobilising more than 300 workers under a trade union for engineers to strike over unfair working conditions for blacks.He also played a major role as taskforce member during unity talks between PF-Zapu and Zanu-PF that culminated in the signing of the Unity Accord in 1987.Between 1996 and 2005, Cde Muchena held the post of chairman for Zanu-PF in Mayihlome district before he was later elected a member of the provincial executive committee for Bulawayo.
