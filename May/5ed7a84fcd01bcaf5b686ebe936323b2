Colossians 1 vs 16; For by Him all things were created, in Heaven or Earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities all things were created through Him and for Him. A friend of mine was involved in a car accident recently. His faith is still at its infancy where he still questions the existence of God because of some of the injustices he witnesses that he just cannot understand.Soon after the accident he was asked to comment on what had just happened. In spite of his doubts, he was quick to conclude that his life had been saved by a power that is greater than he could understand.I thought to myself how extraordinary it was that it took a remarkable event for him to come to the realisation that he was, but a tiny speck, one who God had looked down kindly on and saved from misfortune and death.There are so many things that can sometimes make us doubt or at least strain our faith to a point where we question where we have come from or where we are going. It takes extraordinary events that are out of this world to bring us to the realisation that oh there really is a God who directs my steps. My conversation with my friend was a revelation that during the right moments, God reveals himself in a manner that even His toughest critic will accept that He is there and that He controls all things.What is odd is that those that fellowship and know Him are quick to doubt Him at the first sign of trouble. How many times have you been faced with a tough situation and the first place you turned to was despair rather than crying out to Him to take control of the situation?To every single one of us, God can sometimes become so real that there is no room for doubt, we just have to acknowledge that He made the heavens and the earth.Surely we don t need to experience car accidents or extreme calamity to bring us to the acknowledgement that God does exist.The Bible in the book of Psalms says that only fools say there is no God. That is so true, it takes a remarkable mindset to give all credit to Him and a foolish mindset to discount all He does in our lives and merely attribute it to chance and some random acts of luck.Take time to give glory to Him and He will meet you at your point of need. May He speak to you and reveal Himself to you in a way that is real to you so you can understand His purpose for your life.Be blessed.For more info: Visit our website: www.thefig-tree.org ; e-mail us on: [email&#160;protected]; catch us on StarFM, Monday- Friday 0620hours.
