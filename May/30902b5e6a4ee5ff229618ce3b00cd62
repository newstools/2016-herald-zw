LONDON. Arsene Wenger admits he feared the whole of the Emirates stadium would turn white in protest against him in Saturday s English Premiership soccer match against Norwich. But he ended this game in a stronger position after the majority of Arsenal fans shouted down the protesters calling for him to go and even sang his name in support.The demonstrations turned into a damp squib as only around 200 held up white banners with Time for change on them at the start of the game. By the end even less bothered.In fact, it was a good day all round for Wenger, with his substitution making the difference despite being unpopular with supporters.Danny Welbeck hit the winner six minutes after coming off the bench to boost Arsenal s Champions League hopes.So a day that had begun with Wenger fearing the worst after fans got together to protest against him ended with him relaxed and smiling again.Wenger said: I thought it would be worse, yes. From what I was told, I thought the whole stadium would be white. I can take that. I am in a public job and I have to live with judgement as long as it is respectful. If it is only opinion, we have all to accept that because we are in a public job. We are here to give our best. We have been remarkably consistent at the top. There are disappointed people because we didn t win the league. Believe me, we are as well. Like any Arsenal fans, we have to come back and win it and that is all we can do. Asked whether he thought the protests would stop now that the majority of Arsenal fans have shown they appear to back him, he said: I don t know. You know. I am a football man. I am not a politician. I am not in a democracy. I am in the next game, perform, try to do as well as you can and accept people s opinions. That is what it is about. The Daily Star.
