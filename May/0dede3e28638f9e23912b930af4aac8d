Daniel Arap MoiNairobi. The CORD coalition s quest to have the IEBC disbanded through protests has an unlikely supporter. It seems. Retired president Daniel Arap Moi has backed the protests, if KANU secretary Nick Salat is to be believed. When quizzed about the involvement of the party in the ongoing protests to kick out the IEBC and whether the former president who is a patron in the party as well as lifetime member is happy, Salat says he has the blessings of the big man. If you see me here know that I represent everyone who matters in the party, he stated. Salat has been at the IEBC protests at anniversary towers and will be there next week Monday. There is need for change. That is what we want. There is nothing else we are looking for, he added.Baringo Senator Gideon Moi who is the chairman has yet to comment on the protests. News24.
