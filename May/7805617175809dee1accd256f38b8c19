Paul Munyuki Sports Reporter ZIMBABWE rugby giants Old Georgians and Old Hararians face a test of character that comes with writing a piece of history when the two sides clash this afternoon for the sole ticket to represent the country in the Gold Cup. Old Georgians captain and loose forward, Kingsley Lang, says they want to write a piece of history and become the first Zimbabwean side to play in the South African rugby club competition.That the Dragons have failed when it matters the most in the previous year, including losing the Harare Province Rugby League title to Harare Sports Club on the final day last year, could be motivation enough for Grant Mitchell s side. We have fallen short a number of times at the final hurdle previously. We are a very positive team and things have been going on well for us but at this stage previous results do not matter, what happened in the past would not determine the future. There is always a bit of pressure when it comes to games like these but as Old Georgians, we have quite a number of players that have played at a higher level and are capable of handling pressure, and all we want is to challenge for the big prize. It is massive for Zimbabwe to be included in this competition and this will obviously have an impact on the level and standard of game not only in the clubs but up to the national teams as well, said Lang.Old Georgians have named an experienced squad for this make-or-break Gold Cup final qualifier and in their line-up are props Pieter Jouber and Jakov Jakov, hooker Keith Murray, lock Fortune Chipendu, flanker Jacque Leitao, who have all played for the Sables.Fly-half Lenience Tambwera, Stephan Hunduza and Boyd Rouse have also represented Zimbabwe at senior level but with injuries being their major concern ahead of the clash, Old Hararians have a number of experienced players for this game. Veteran lock Constantine Costa Dinha and diminutive flanker Prayer Chitenderu have come out of retirement to help the Old Boys who had hit a hard time but captain Tawanda Chowe feels the young players in their ranks will be equal to the challenge.The Old Boys will be without fly-half Tichafara Makwanya, who picked an achilles tendon injury against the same side two weeks ago, centres Cleopas Makotose and Leeroy Mashiri and Corney Mwatsiya. The number of injuries we have has affected us negatively in our preparations but the youngsters have also shown that they can play the same roles that the senior players have been playing and they will do the job in the final. They have been good in the training sessions over the past week, said Chowe.Fixtures: Allan Wilson v Marlborough (11am), Old Johannians II v Old Georgians II (12.20pm), Old Georgians v Old Hararians (3pm).*All games at Police Grounds
