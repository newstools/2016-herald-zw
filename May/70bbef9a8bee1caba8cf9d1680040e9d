Prosper Dembedza Court Correspondent A DEBT collector with the National Employment Council for Welfare and Education Institutions yesterday appeared in court for converting $68 286 to his personal use.Joseph Malachi Kudiwa (34) was facing theft charges when he appeared before Harare magistrate Mr Tendai Mahwe. He was granted $100 bail and will be back in court on May 4.As part of his bail conditions, he was ordered not to interfere with State witnesses, reside at his given address, and surrender his passport and to report once a week to the police.Prosecutor Ms Idah Maromo had opposed the granting of bail to Kudiwa citing that he was a flight risk, and was facing a very serious offence, hence he was not a fit and proper candidate for bail.In granting bail, Mr Mahwe said bail is now a constitutional right which can only be denied if there are compelling reasons. The State failed to give reasonable grounds on why the accused person can be denied bail, he said.Allegations are that during the period extending from 2009 to August 2012, Kudiwa collected money from Athol Evans, Celebration Centre, Fairways Home, Royal Academy, Tops Nursery and Waterfalls Care Trust amounting to $68 286 on behalf of National Employment Council for Welfare and Education Institutions.The court heard that after collecting the money, Kudiwa allegedly converted it to his own use and nothing was recovered.
