Gilbert Munetsi THE Midlands city of Kwekwe will host the first round of celebrations for recently crowned WBC welterweight silver champion, Charles Manyuchi, with a tournament to his tribute to be staged at the Tropicana Hotel. Dubbed the Midlands Bees Manyuchi Invitational Tournament, the event is expected to attract the cr me-de-la-cr me of amateur talent from all corners of the country, among them Trade Nkomozavo, Ndodana Moyo, Prince Cutter, Liberty Muwani, Brandon Dennis and Future Maziya.The international boxing superstar s principal sponsor, MrT35, are bankrolling the all-night fists-filled fixture expected to arouse the sleepy city from its usual slumber.Manyuchi will grace the occasion and parade his trophy.According to the organising secretary of the tournament, Alvote Mutakiwa, responses have been overwhelming with clubs, including the Zimbabwe National Army School of Physical Sport and Training coached by former Olympian Alexander Kwangwari, Gweru-based Action Boxing Club founded by former Commonwealth Champion Langton Schoolboy Tinago, Triangle, Hwange and the Tshaka Boxing Club from Bulawayo all confirming attendance.Traditionally, the Bees Manyuchi Invitational Tournament, organised as a way by the world champion to give back to the community that made him what he is today, is held in his town of residency, Chivhu, and at one time it was also held at the City Sports Centre in Harare.Before turning professional on February 14, 2009 in his debut against Isaac Phonkeni, Manyuchi had achieved a colourful record, cemented by a four gold medal haul from the Zimbabwe National Youth Games in succeeding years.He never succumbed to defeat during the entirety of his amateur career. So, we are fortunate in that a national and world champion finds it in his heart to retrace his footsteps and help uplift the sport from the grassroots. It is not only the gesture that we are grateful for, but the inspirational factor it brings with it. Every young boxer wishes to scale the same heights the champion has managed to do and seeing him in flesh makes them even more motivated than just seeing their hero in print and pictures, Mutakiwa said.Meanwhile, the Zimbabwe Business Awards Council have added a voice to the need for the corporate world to support Manyuchi so he may fulfil all his career s desires.Speaking at a breakfast leadership awards presentation ceremony at a city hotel last Friday, the council s president, Chamu Chiwanza, said Zimbabwe should emulate what other countries do in support of their heroes. We need to look ourselves in the mirror and reflect on what part we are playing as a critical sector to prop up the image of our country through sport icons like Charles, Chiwanza said, acknowledging the presence of the boxer who had been invited as a special guest.
