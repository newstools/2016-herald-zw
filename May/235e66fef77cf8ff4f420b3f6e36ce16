Lusaka. Zambian bishop John Mambo, has reportedly urged the government to look into reports that foreigners were being allowed to register to vote in the upcoming presidential polls. According to The Post, Mambo said the issue of foreigners registering to vote in the southern African country was bound to cause chaos after the August 11 elections.Reports last week indicated that the Electoral Commission of Zambia had registered thousands of foreigners.A report by The Maravi Post, claimed that the foreigners had been mobilised by the PF to take part in the August 11 elections.Mambo said, with the way the PF was handling things, Zambians were supposed to pray that there was no bloodshed ahead of the elections. We cannot have people who are this power hungry, who can even go and register foreigners. This is to say that the only thing they are failing to do is to raise the dead to come and register and vote for them, Mambo was quoted as saying. News24.
