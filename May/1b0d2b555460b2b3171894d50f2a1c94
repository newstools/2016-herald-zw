Charles Mungoshi Jr Versatile Fufu Well I used to think that it s a bit out of sanity to write down a list of things you are planning to do. The truth is diversion is the order of existence you are prone to being easily swayed from the plot by the days activities. The way life is now we need to have a constant reminder or pointers to the target because the world is now too fast and can trap you in its business. You know what I am talking about &#8211; that sigh of great disappointment in yourself for having forgotten a simple thing like moving a bag from one car to another car.This causes so much anger because you might have lost a whole two hours or it would cost you a whole day. Managing time needs you to list your day s plan, there are no two ways about it. I used to say how can I not remember things that I must do &#8211; but I came to realise that it s easy to get carried away by one activity and miss the other ones.Write it down &#8211; then someone asks how do I remember my things to do list? If you can make it a habit to manage your day in zones or time segments &#8211; give yourself every hour to look or trace if you are on track. Give yourself to this behaviour for the next seven days it will become a habit.The simple things you miss in a day are the ones that cost you the greatest change you can ever have. I have had my mind clouded with the fact that I saw my stuff as too many and then I decided to list down the things I wanted to do and I came to the knowledge of how these things weren t much. List down what you do!I spent a day with Phionah Riekert, the most focused business lady I know and she emphasised that results are easy to record when you have listed activities to engage in and it also saves time. When you need make an impact learn to jot down all you need to do and learn to follow through.
