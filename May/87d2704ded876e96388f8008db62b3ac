We have revamped the technical team and we are hopeful that we will start to get positive results from this encounter. The players have been doing well at training and for the next five games we will be assessing the stand-in executive. We need to make the sponsors happy by winning games and the divisions which had rocked the team are over. We have a good side that plays well, but we respect our opponents who beat us last season and I believe we will win this time around, Washili said.Mutoko Traders owner Chido Mudzinganyama said they will not look into the challenges affecting Surrey Abattoirs. We always enjoy playing at Surrey as it is as good as home to us and we will not underrate them as all the teams in the league have the same potential.

The challenge will be on the coach in terms of selection, Mudzinganyama said.Eastern Region FixturesToday: Africa Trust v Mwenezana (Mwonzora), Tenax v Masvingo City (Sakubva), Prime Rangers v Renco Mine (Ruwa), Surrey v Mutoko Traders (Surrey), Bufaloes v Gutu (Sakubva), Black Eagles v Yadah Stars (Gaza), Chibi v Calvary (Mucheke), Mupandawana v Melfort (Paradise)Central Region FixturesToday: Tongogara V Jesse Mine( Battle Felds), ZRP Gwanda v Gweru United (Pelandaba), ZRP v Blanket Mine (Dulibadzimu), Ivan Hoe Mine v MSU(Amaveni)Tomorrow: Shabanie Mine v Kwekwe Sables (Maglas), Nichrut v Chrome Stars (Peak Mine), ZPC Munyati v Vumbachikwe (Munyati), FC Platinum U-19 v Whawha (Mandava).
