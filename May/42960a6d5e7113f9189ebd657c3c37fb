NEW DELHI. Former England cricket coach Peter Moores has turned down an opportunity to succeed Waqar Younis as the new Pakistan coach, the 53-year-old Englishman said.Coaching Pakistan, traditionally a fractious bunch of talented individuals, is one of the toughest jobs in international cricket and Younis stepped down a disillusioned man last month after the team s poor World Twenty20 display in India.Younis exit has forced the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) into fresh head-hunting and Moores said he declined a chance to return to international coaching after England sacked him for the second time last year.
