Midlands Correspondent Over 600 desperate home-seekers in Gweru are slowly losing confidence in a property developing company, Tinshel Properties and Construction (Pvt) Ltd, whose chief executive officer, Mr Tinashe Manzungu, recently deserted the organisation and formed another firm, ZimBuild. Tinshel s property was recently attached and auctioned after one of the clients. Ms Vongai Chihanga, successfully reclaimed her money after taking Mr Manzungu to court and obtained a writ of execution.Mr Manzungu is the reigning national Small to Medium Enterprises (SMEs) Businessman of the Year.Property, including a Toyota Hilux, a Nissan March and other office furniture and equipment, was recently attached after Tinshel failed to settle a $5 900 debt resulting in the client demanding over $ 6 000.In the particulars of claims Ms Chihanga claimed that Tinshel backtracked on a deal where they had agreed to construct a house for her at a cost of about $ 14 000. Sometime in January 2013, plaintiff joined the housing project offered by the defendants and was offered a residential stand in Montrose, Gweru, at the purchase price of $2 000. Defendants undertook to build a five- roomed house for plaintiff at a cost of $14 000 which amount was to be paid back in monthly instalments of $205. Defendants later advised that the purchase price for the house they were constructing had increased to $ 37 000 before being reduced again to $30 000. On June, 9 2015 plaintiff entered into an agreement of sale with first defendant for the construction of a five-roomed house at Montrose residential suburb at a total cost of $30 000, which amount was to be paid in monthly instalments of $205 per month, reads Ms Chihanga s demands.It is understood that on June 26 last year the plaintiff received a letter from Tinshel demanding $605 deposit before the construction of the house.The demand did not form part of the agreement signed by the two parties.Ms Chihanga demanded $6 528 restitution and compensation to which Tinshel agreed to pay.However, Tinshel later breached the deal leading to the attachment and auctioning of the property.Meanwhile, Tinshel and its CEO Manzungu have been dragged to court after duping a home seeker $6 310 in a foiled land deal.Papers in possession of The Herald indicate that during the period extending from March 2013 to June 2015 Ms Abigail Manyebvu paid Mr Manzungu about $6 000 for an allocation of 300 square metre stand in Montrose, Gweru, and paid monthly instalments of $220 towards the construction of the house. On November 29 2012, I paid a joining fee and subscription fee of $95 for a stand. After three months of payment Tinshel told me that I was entitled to a house after two years. I started paying $220 on June 26, 2013 upto June 2015 where the defendant called me to meet and was told he was no longer able to give me the house as they had promised, claimed Ms Manyebvu in the summons.Gweru Civil Court magistrate Ms Florence Nago ordered Tinshel to pay $ 6 310 to Ms Manyebvu. Mr Manzungu confirmed that his company s property was attached in February this year. I am aware and it happened in February, he said.
