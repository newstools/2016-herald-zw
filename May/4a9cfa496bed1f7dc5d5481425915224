Silver Screen with Tafadzwa Zimoyo One good thing is that ZTV has also made a giraffe stride in the leap towards matching international standards of broadcasting.Happy be-lated Workers Day. It is good to just have a day of rest as workers to enjoy various leisure activities. It has been a long weekend and there were many people at various local relaxing joints.Well, local is lekker, no matter how good and appealing some foreign products might look like.This is the cue that ZTV seems to be taking these days if the trajectory that they are nowadays is anything to go by.After being bombarded by constructive criticism left, right and centre, it is clear that the station accepts advice and puts it to good use.There is a marked and remarkable change when it comes to their standards, especially on the news desks and segments.While some of the obvious bleeps and blunders have become more like jetsam which is unwanted material that should be thrown overboard in order to keep a sinking ship afloat this is the same thing that ZTV has done.The captains of the ZTV ship have removed the wax that was clogging their ears and they have embraced advice from their loyal partners who include, in the majority, the viewers and license payers as well as the advertisers who keep the business side of the corporation rolling.It is not that it s now the best but just to say it is improving and whoever said progress was not a slow process wasn t talking about what is happening at the station.One good thing is that ZTV has also made a giraffe stride in the leap towards matching international standards of broadcasting.No one can take away the fact that ZTV is now abreast with some of the leading stations and broadcasting corporations in the region, taking notes from immediate neighbour, South Africa s SABC.SABC is one of the leading and most reliable news dissemination sources not in Southern Africa but the African continent at large.By virtue of that, they have set a precedent for other channels and corporations in various parts of Africa to follow suite by show how Africa should lag behind in the global village when it comes quality broadcasting.This is the same trajectory that ZBCTV is following.The station has even brought in a crop of new and vibrant staffers to complement the team of seasoned personnel who know how the aisle is walked .Yes some beautiful newsbae with new set although somehow still some shadows.We saw the grand entrance of Merelyn Ngwena during the lunch hour news.By gelling new and seasoned personnel, ZBCTV has managed to cross-fertilise ideas which is a great boon to the station.While in the past, the news segment was treated as a boring aspect of television viewing owing to the dull and insipid nature that the news-readers would present while reading the news, this time around news time is something worth waiting for and watching.There are few instances whereby viewers turn to other news channels like CNN among others in order to get that vibrant, vigorous, interesting and up-to-the-dot news reportage.ZBCTV has regained the confidence of a big chuck of their viewers by upping their standards.With Zimbabweans being an entertainment craze nation, movies have become one of their ways out of the stress that makes its toll on them.There was a shift in the past towards relying on M-Net for the best movies.But now, after ZBCTV had done its homework, they then realized that there was a gap that needed to be filled and this void was plugged through the screening of movies that state the appetite of the local viewers.Now, movie buffs can tune into the local channel and view movies of their choice without any grumbles.However, more needs to be done in terms of promoting local productions, be they dramas, movies, documentaries, etc.There is need for the local channel to tap widely from others experiences in a bid to make that huge leap.While it is not an easy stroll in the park, but through the engagement of various players like the influential corporates, we will reach the apex of broadcasting excellence.On to DSTV , weeks ago the world learnt of the sad passing of musical legend Prince, who left behind a legacy well worth remembering.In honour of the pop icon, M-Net channel 101 (also simulcast on Mzansi Magic Music channel 321 ) aired an entertaining music special titled Prince: Behind The Symbol last Sunday , at 16:30.The part documentary/concert exclusive featured the music legend s extraordinary performance at the Los Angeles Forum in 2011.The special also covered interviews with celebrities George Lopez, Boris Kodjoe and Maya Rudolph among others, as well as quick inserts with serious fans of the iconic musician.However during his lifetime Prince garnered a number of awards which include:1985 Academy Awards Best Music, Original Song Score for Purple Rain 1985 Grammy Best Album of Instrumental Score Written for a Motion Picture or Television Special Purple Rain 1996 Brit Awards Best International Male2004 Grammy Special Award Purple Rain which he shared with his team2005 Grammy Best R&amp;B Vocal Performance Male for the song Call My Name and Best Traditional R&amp;B Vocal Performance for the song Musicology 2007 Golden Globes Best Original Song &#8211;
