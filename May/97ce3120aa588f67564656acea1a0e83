Dr Amai MugabeProsper Ndlovu Bulawayo Bureau The First Lady Amai Grace Mugabe yesterday said Bulawayo is on a path to robust re-industrialisation, having survived the devastating effects of economic sanctions that led to the collapse of many companies and loss of jobs. In a keynote address read on her behalf by Zanu-PF Women s League deputy secretary, Cde Eunice Sandi Moyo during the Zim-Asset Bulawayo stakeholders engagement conference, the First Lady said numerous initiatives embraced under the Government s economic blueprint had started impacting positively on the city s economy.She called for speedy implementation of turnaround strategies that are anchored on technological innovation to ensure achievement of desired targets within a short space of time. Despite the challenges it has faced over the years, this city awaits a bright future for economic turnaround. Bulawayo still has vibrant think tanks that can steer it forward and it mustn t be allowed to die. My message to Bulawayo is that of hope, resilience and innovation as the city moves forward to embracing new forms of development models that can impact positively on its development, said the First Lady during the conference being held at the Zimbabwe International Trade Fair.She said Bulawayo has distinguished itself through its resilience amid a challenging economic environment, which has seen it forge ahead to reclaim its traditional industrial status. Bulawayo does have its success story and it needs to be told to show that some companies have been innovative in moving forward without necessarily waiting for bailout from the Government and they have built confidence around Bulawayo s economy, said Cde Mugabe. Companies like Arenel, Choppies, United Refineries and Afroflex have increased their foothold on the continent. Yes some are closed, but these haven t given up and as such we need to cultivate that survival spirit, which should be cross cutting. These companies have contributed to employment creation and empowerment to families and the community at large.The First Lady said the implementation of Zim-Asset has gained momentum under the 10-point plan approach enunciated by President Mugabe last year.The plan seeks to harness collective efforts from both private and public sectors towards economic progress. The First Lady stressed the need to strengthen monitoring and evaluation processes to enhance results based management that was adopted by the Government to increase accountability of public officials and achieve set goals.Zim-Asset was adopted in 2013 as a five-year economic blueprint by the Zanu-PF Government after the harmonised elections.Amai Mugabe said the four clusters under Zim-Asset food security and nutrition, value addition and beneficiation, infrastructure and utilities, social services and poverty eradication required a sound infrastructure backing and solid production.She underscored the need for deliberate efforts in revitalising agriculture and the agro-processing value chain as well as focus on energy, water, transport and ICTs sectors, the unlocking of potential of SMEs, restoration of confidence in the financial services sector, promoting joint ventures and modernising labour laws.The First Lady said turning Bulawayo s economy around should also be buttressed by the resuscitation of key parastatals such as the National Railways of Zimbabwe, whose role is critical in making the city a regional industrial hub.She said the recent familiarisation tours done by Vice President Phelekezela Mphoko and Chief Secretary to the Office of the President and Cabinet, Misheck Sibanda, in March and April this year, show the interest Government has in revamping Bulawayo.Amai Mugabe said the declaration of Bulawayo as a Special Economic Zone would yield increased economic activity, liquidity and employment. She added that SEZs would spur revitalisation of local industry, regional linkages through broad road networks, rail linkages and strategic positioning that would place Bulawayo as a perfect regional manufacturing hub.The meeting, which is running under the theme Consolidating Bulawayo s Growth Through Zim-Asset , is meant to bring various ministers closer to the people to clarify issues that affect them.VP Mphoko, Cabinet ministers: Dr Chris Mushohwe (Information and Media and Broadcasting Services), Simon Khaya Moyo (Policy Implementation), Tshinga Dube (War Veterans), Sithembiso Nyoni (SMEs), Samuel Undenge (Energy), deputy ministers Paddy Zhanda Obedingwa Mguni and Thokozile Mathuthu (Information, Media and Broadcasting Services), parliamentarians and the business community attended the meeting.
