Children of varying ages are set to enjoy a fun-filled edu-tainment programmed that has been formulated by the Music Crossroads Academy Zimbabwe (MCAZ). This will see kids aged four to 17 converging at Nzou Arts and Cultural Centre in Belgravia for exciting music sessions every Saturday. The programme, which kicked off last weekend, aims at identifying inherent music gifts in children and to help cultivate this talent in ways that will see music being taken seriously in this country.At least 35 children from different parts of Harare and Chitungwiza attended the music lessons at MCAZ Academy.They were grouped into three teams according to their age groups.
