Elita Chikwati : Agriculture ReporterSADC climate experts are in the country for the 20th Southern Africa Regional Climate Outlook Forum (Sarcof ) strategic planning workshop that is expected to produce the rainfall forecast for the region. The 10-day workshop is being attended by climate experts and meteorological experts from 14 SADC countries including Zimbabwe, Zambia, Botswana, South Africa, Lesotho, Mozambique and Malawi among others. SADC Climate Services Centre, coordinator, Dr Brad Garanganga yesterday said the function was held annually and brought together experts from the region under the Climate Services Centre. The experts will work together to come up with the regional forecast for the upcoming rainfall season. These forecasts are important for planning purposes and, policy makers should also make use of the information to plan for different activities and programmes. Climate information is useful to people in the health sector, agriculture, retailing and tourism among others. There is no sector that is immune to climate, he said.Dr Garanganga said it was important for stakeholders to take the information seriously to avoid unnecessary losses.He expressed concern that people were not taking climate and weather information seriously, and sometimes ended up in problems that could have been avoided. It is also important that Meteorological departments are capacitated. Governments should invest in the meteorology as this has several benefits to all sectors including boosting the economy as corrective measures are taken timely. Research has shown that a dollar invested in meteorology yields $15, he said.&nbsp;
