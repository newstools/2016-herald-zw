Bongani NgqulungaCAPE TOWN. The South African Presidency on Sunday denied reports alleging a rift between the Presidency and the National Treasury in relation to providing support to the South African Airways (SAA).

The Sunday Times reported that the national carrier, which is allegedly on the brink of bankruptcy, has been given until early next month to submit its annual financial statement or face deregistration in Hong Kong. The report said that the Hong Kong registrar of companies has threatened to ground all flights to Hong Kong if SAA fails to meet the deadline on September 6.According to the report, the Presidency had a rift with Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan over the SAA s request for a five-billion-rand (about $378 million) bailout, which Gordhan has declined.Meanwhile, SAA spokesperson Tladi Tladi said that contrary to the report, he believes the airline will meet the deadline and flights will not be affected.
