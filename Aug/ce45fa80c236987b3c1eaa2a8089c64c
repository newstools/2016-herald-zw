Edgar LunguLUSAKA. &#8211; Late President Michael Sata left a legacy of refusing to promote violence even when he and his supporters strongly believed that they had been cheated out of State House. In 2006, President Sata, then as leader of the Patriotic Front (PF), restrained his supporters from taking to the streets when it emerged that after a strong showing in the presidential race, he lost to then incumbent Levy Mwanawasa. In 2008, Sata yet again put up a spirited fight, only to lose narrowly to Rupiah Banda, who was vice-president.Sata was very categorical in stopping his members from taking the law into their hands in protesting the loss.He put the country s interests first above his political ego and waited for God s time for him to be president of Zambia.When 2011 came, it was clear it was his time as the PF swept to power with an overwhelming majority. God s time is always the best.In the aftermath of the 2016 elections, President-elect Edgar Lungu urged the justifiably jubilant Patriotic Front (PF) supporters not to mock their defeated political rivals. The supporters have heeded this advice made to foster unity.Sadly, however, there has been violence and arson in some parts of Southern and Western provinces.The two regions are strongholds for the major opposition United Party for National Development (UPND).Hakainde HichilemaThe UPND has in the last two elections come close to gaining state power and patience will do if the party president Hakainde Hichilema is destined to be President of Zambia.Therefore, the violence that has rocked Southern and Western provinces is unacceptable.This violence is seemingly being tolerated by the UPND leadership because it has the responsibility and influence to stop it since it is happening in its strongholds.That is why President-elect Lungu says he will meet Hichilema only after the opposition leader goes to Southern Province to stop his supporters from attacking innocent citizens.Lungu urged Hichilema and his running mate Geoffrey Mwamba to call for calm and peace among their supporters as they await the outcome of the presidential petition in the Constitutional Court.Hichilema is on the spot and should do what is expected of him to end this violence. It is one thing to issue a statement calling for a ceasefire from Lusaka and totally another to actually face his supporters and order them to stop the violence. He must emulate President-elect Lungu and walk the talk on stopping violence.Zambia is a peaceful country. This peace and stability should not be disturbed by frustrated cadres who do not mean well for this great country. &#8211; Zambia Daily Mail
