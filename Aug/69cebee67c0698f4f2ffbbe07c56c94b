PARIS. The national identity crisis exposed by France s burkini controversy is threatening to set the tone for the country s presidential campaign.Along with the economy, the relationship between France s Muslims and non-Muslims has been a recurring theme as presidential hopefuls kick off campaigning for the April-May election. Some leftists say the far right is using the issue to encourage racism in France. A top French court ruling on Friday against banning the burkini didn t put an end to the debate. Some mayors are refusing to rescind their bans, arguing that the head-to-ankle swimwear could disrupt public order after a summer marred by Islamic extremist attacks.The burkini bans by some French coastal towns drew international condemnation after images circulated online of police appearing to require a Muslim woman to dis- robe.Former President Nicolas Sarkozy and other some other conservative candidates want a national law banning burkinis. Sarkozy s chief rival for the conservative nomination, former prime minister Alain Juppe, struck a more conciliatory tone, saying on Europe-1 radio yesterday that such rhetoric throws oil on the fire .But at a campaign event on Saturday in Chatou west of Paris, Juppe suggested putting limits on how far religious practices can reach into public life, calling for a special accord between the state and Muslim leaders to lay out clear rules for respecting French secularism. &#8211; AP.
