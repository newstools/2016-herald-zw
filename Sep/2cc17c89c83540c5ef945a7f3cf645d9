SINGAPORE. Triple Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton could do little at the Singapore Grand Prix on Sunday to prevent Mercedes team mate Nico Rosberg from leapfrogging him in the Formula One standings but the Briton will not give up his title without a fight. Hamilton rallied from a big early season deficit to overhaul Rosberg in the standings but after the German led from pole to flag in Singapore to claim a third straight victory, the Briton finds himself eight points adrift after his third place finish. We have a good car and we ve got to have a good weekend, Hamilton told reporters as he looked ahead to the next race in Malaysia. We ve come from 43 points down so theoretically eight points isn t anywhere near as steep as that but still, Nico s been performing fantastically well. This weekend he s done an amazing job. I expect him to continue like that so I ve got make sure that I do the same. Reuters.
