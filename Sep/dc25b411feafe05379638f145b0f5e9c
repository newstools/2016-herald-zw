Walter Mswazie Bulawayo Bureau Operations of Dr Joice Mujuru s Zimbabwe People First (ZimPF) in Masvingo are almost grounded as the wrangle over the recent demotion from the provincial chairpersonship of Retired Colonel Claudius Makova intensifies. On Tuesday, the national executive sent a team of four members for a crisis meeting with the provisional executive to address the dispute.Rtd Col Makova was recently elevated to the council of elders in the party, but he feels that the promotion is effectively a demotion.He was replaced by Dr William Zivenge after being accused of lack of commitment, a decision which has been opposed by the national executive.The other executive members are former MDC-T MP Mr Jeffrey Chitando, who is the new provincial secretary for information and publicity, Mr Oliver Chirume (secretary for administration), Mr Moses Mare (secretary for labour), Mr Ernest Mudavanhu (secretary for mass mobilisation) and Mr Tichaona Sithole (secretary for business and economic planning).Rtd Col Makova has vowed to stay put and declared that he is still in charge. I am not aware of the so-called elections held at Dzikamai Mavhaire s house in Masvingo, which demoted me from the provincial chairmanship. I am still the provincial chairman of ZimPF, said Rtd Col Makova.Mr Chitando tried to play down the crisis in the beleaguered party, but admitted that Rtd Col Makova was refusing to accept his demotion. It is true that we have a new executive led by Dr Zivenge now, after Rtd Col Makova was promoted into the council of elders. Rtd Col Makova is, however, refusing to accept his new role and we are seized with the matter as I speak, said Mr Chitando.ZimPF national spokesperson Mr Jealousy Mawarire professed ignorance of the new developments and said there have not been any changes in Masvingo. As far as we know, there are no leadership changes in Masvingo. We have sent a team of four senior officials there in Masvingo to resolve the dispute, said Mr Mawarire.
