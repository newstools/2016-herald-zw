Shepherd Chimururi : Cool Lifestyle CorrespondentThe introduction of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM)-oriented new curriculum makes it a necessity not a luxury for all schools to have computers for educational purposes. Education is becoming more paperless as electronic notes, audio visual libraries and virtual laboratories, which cost a fraction of convectional books takes over worldwide.Students are liking it too as learning has not just been made simple but exciting and learner-centred. It has been proved that students enjoy researching on computer than reading from conventional books.This in turn boosts the pass rate. Educational resources are becoming internet based, schools without computers risk falling behind their counterparts who learn using computers.Studying via the internet is now a key part of children s education and it is unfair that learning opportunities are being affected by scarcity of computers, said former Buhera High school student, Blessing Magunda.She said they are being denied equal access to knowledge and information that are part of education in the 21st century.Computers have taken over attention of students.Where the old generation used to carry a satchel full of books we now carry a USB flash.Where they used to labour to write notes manually, we now easily download hundreds of pages of soft copy in pdf format in a few seconds.Learning has been made simple.Where learners used imagination to understand foreign and abstract concepts like the Mt Everest, volcanoes, digestive system, water cycle, they can now see documentaries of real things or get a clearer picture through use of animations.All you need is to be a computer literate and have internet connectivity so that you download what ever you want. The virtual lab software is an added advantage to students who do sciences because it shows all experiments.Schools need to use technology to revolutionise their teaching.JS Omah primary school boasts of a computer laboratory loaded with educational softwares. Our teacher Mr Ignitius Dhihwa makes learning easier for us by first explaining the topic using the board then play the video for us on his laptop were we watch what he was talking about while we take notes. I have never failed a class exercise which I was taught using audio visual aids, said Ticharwa Madondo (11) a Grade Six student.He said in our class we prefer to learn from a basic power point presentation with a voice over which gives us a high rate of understanding than reading notes on the board. At home I have my own collection of educational DVDs which I watch using my laptop. When learning through video tutorials a spirit of motivation lifts up my soul. So it is easier when I am reading I will be seeing the vision, he said.City Academy Form Four student, Mary Jane Maremba (16) said students should not be just computer literate but efficient because you will need to use the computer at college or university level with some lecturers no longer marking hard copies. All you need is to submit your typed assignment via email. If you go there without the skill it will take a lot of time to adjust or it can affecting your studies.I am of the view that computer operation skills should be compulsory starting at form three level in preparation for life after school. Students should be equipped with computer skills to use at the job market.Many Government departments are computerising their systems like application of passport, application of taxes and now at Zimsec there is e-marking, she said.The onus is now upon teachers and headmasters to go to workshops that can make them understand the value of computers at school because sometimes it is not about money but lack of knowledge.Shepherd Chimururi Executive Director Dzidzo Inhaka Audio Visual Learning; Mobile: +263 772 608 276 Tel: 04 749 302; e-mail: [email&#160;protected], website: www.dzidzoinhaka.co.zw
