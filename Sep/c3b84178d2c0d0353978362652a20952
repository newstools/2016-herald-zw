DUBLIN. Robbie Keane ended his international soccer career in perfect fashion, scoring his historic 68th goal in his 146th and final Ireland appearance in Wednesday night s 4-0 friendly thrashing of Oman in Dublin.The 30th-minute volley drew the Los Angeles Galaxy forward level with German World Cup winner Gerd Muller in the international all-time goalscoring charts. Strike partner Jon Walters turned provider for the goal, and when Keane scooped the ball over defender Nadir Mabrook s head inside the penalty area, there was no doubt what would happen next.There was the slightest hesitation to line up the perfect contact, but it was a case of deja vu from then on with the ball hitting the net and Keane off and running towards the crowd, with his famous cartwheel celebration rolled out for one last performance.There was no shock Keane got on the scoreboard, the only surprise was it took half an hour in a pre-World Cup qualifying friendly.Oman were always likely to become the 37th different country Keane scored against, especially with the entire team and crowd willing the Dubliner on.The 36-year-old was captain for the night, as well as the main attraction in Lansdowne Road, with the President of Ireland making a personal presentation to him before kick off.There were also video tributes from Pele, Steven Gerrard and Bono, the U2 lead singer, but the only presentation Keane wanted was a goal on a platter.Before he could celebrate his own strike, though, another Robbie made his mark Robbie Brady, who scored twice for Ireland at Euro 2016, curling home a beautiful free kick after just seven minutes.He lifted it over the static wall with ease, and it was well out of the reach of Faiz Al Rushaidi in the Oman goal.Harry Arter, making a push for inclusion in next Monday s World Cup 2018 qualifier in Serbia, might typically have shot in the position he found himself on 13 minutes, but instead tried and failed to thread a pass through for Keane.
