The youths were returning from Gaza Stadium where they had attended the launch of a residential stands programme in the district. I am having a hard time with two individuals who are causing pandemonium in this province. I have tried to advise them to refrain from secret meetings with the agenda of putting the party into disrepute but they want me to be accused of failing to run this province. I have even written a letter to the President warning him that I do not think they deserve their positions. Cde Win Mlambo and his counterpart must be investigated and put in their right places,&#8221; said Cde Chimene pointing at Dr Mlambo who, however, did not respond.
