We are further instructed that should you fail to respond favourably to this request in the next seven day, we will proceed to file an application at the High Court to compel you to furnish us with a certificate for private prosecution, reads part of the letter to the Acting PG.It is alleged Col Siziba assaulted Mrs Ziyambi on February 13 last year at the New Government Complex in Harare.Mrs Ziyambi filed assault and indecent assault charges at Harare Central Police Station under CR 1054/ 2/ 15 and the cases were also vetted at the PG s office under reference number AG170/ 15.Col Siziba was summoned to appear at the Harare Magistrates Court, but the PG later declined to prosecute the case.On the day in question, it is alleged Mrs Ziyambi had a meeting with deputy national director (public prosecutions) Mr Nelson Mutsonziwa in her office discussing administrative issues affecting the NPA.While the two were still having their meeting, it is alleged, Col Siziba stormed into the office and asked to meet Mrs Ziyambi.After a while, Mrs Ziyambi invited Col Siziba into her office and together with Mr Mutsonziwa, they allegedly discussed outstanding issues on fuel allocation to their officers and the meeting ended in a debate.It is alleged that Col Siziba requested Mr Mutsonziwa to excuse them for about two minutes as he indicated that he had something to say to Mrs Ziyambi in private.
