Walter Nyamukondiwa Chinhoyi Bureau Jailed Chinhoyi security guard and serial child molester Chenjerai Mairosi, who is serving 46 years in prison for sexual assault involving 10 boys, faces fresh indecent assault charges. Mairosi (38) was convicted and sentenced to 52 years in prison by Chinhoyi regional magistrate Mr Felix Mawadze last week but six years were suspended on condition that he does not commit a similar offence.He now faces a count of indecent assault involving a nine-year-old girl whom he indecently touched on her back.Another 11-year-old boy has also come forward alleging that Mairosi abused him on three occasions after visiting him at his home.The boy alleges that sometime this year, he was taken by a friend to Mairosi s home where they were served with tea and bread.He called him to his house on another day and asked the boy to lie on his bed as he wanted to show him how to be intimate with a woman when he reached adulthood.He allegedly sexually abused him before giving him $1.Mairosi asked the boy not to tell anyone.The boy said owing to the lure of Mairosi s bicycle, prospects of getting some money and assurances from friends who also frequented his place, he went back to his house on two other occasions.He was sexually abused on both occasions including in one instance when Mairosi abused him and his friend before giving them $2 each.On the third occasion he was abused, Mairosi allegedly said he had no money and promised to give him next time.The matter came to light when a friend to the boy s mother reported that the boy was frequenting Mairosi s house.He was quizzed and confirmed the abuse.Mairosi is expected to appear in court soon to answer to the fresh charges.He is serving 46 years in prison after being convicted on five counts of aggravated indecent assault charges involving five boys and three counts of indecent assault.Mairosi was, however, acquitted on two other counts of aggravated indecent assault.If he serves the full term, Mairosi will be around 84 years when he comes out of prison.
