Takudzwa Chitsiga : Sports ReporterTONGO Charamba took control on day two of Revitalisation of HIV and Cancer prevention pro-am golf tournament second round at Royal Harare yesterday. Charamba, who last played competitively in Swaziland in May, carded a three-under total after the 36 holes to go into today s final round leading another serious contender Steven Ferreira by a single shot. The Chapman professional had a two-under 70 yesterday to compliment Wednesday s one-under on a windy day. I had a good but challenging round today (yesterday) because of the wind but I managed some good shots, said Charamba. The course is playing well but wind affected most players as the board can show. I was rusty as I last played competitively way back in May, I even failed to do some basics which was very unusual. Tomorrow (today) I will play my normal game and see what will happen. There are good players in there and the guys behind me were playing regular golf so it will be tough but I will do my best. I hope there won t be a lot of wind tomorrow so we can enjoy the game, said Charamba.Ferreira, who has been doing well on the Sunshine Tour, was in second place after carding two-under after the 36-holes.He is followed by Ryan Cairns who shot a one-under-par yesterday to compliment his level par on the opening day.A total of 20 players proceeded to today s final round which will see the winner walking away with about R45 000 in prize money.Opening day leader Greg Bentley was in fourth position four after he lost his way to struggle to a 76 yesterday.Top amateur David Amm continues to do well as he made the cut.After an opening round of 75, the Chapman amateur returned with a one-under 71 while Garry Thompson is on two-over par.Peter Banda on five-over par in eighth while Trainos Muradzikwa, Davison Elija, Mahommed Mandhu, Visitor Mapwanya, Nickson Masunga and Clive Nguru were all tied in ninth place.Robson Saurombe, Brian Gondo, Nyasha and Day Muyambo missed the cut.Zimbabwe Professional Golfers Tour president Garry Thompson hailed the players.
