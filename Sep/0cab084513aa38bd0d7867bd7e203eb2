MADRID Madrid minnows Leganes get their reward for an unlikely promotion to the Spanish La Liga when the might of Barcelona s Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar grace the 11 000-capacity Estadio Butarque today. Leganes have made a fine start to their first season in the Spanish top-flight, winning at Celta Vigo on the opening weekend and holding Champions League finalists Atletico Madrid to a 0-0 draw at the Butarque. However, Leganes face an even tougher task in stopping a rampant MSN of Messi, Suarez and Neymar fresh from scoring six of Barca s seven goals in a Champions League rout of Celtic in midweek on their first start of the season together.Barca were in no mood for complacency on Tuesday after a shock 2-1 home defeat to another newly promoted side, Alaves, ended their perfect start to the La Liga season last weekend.Leganes defender Pablo Insua says the Alaves result gives the hosts hope. We have to do everything right and have luck, Insua told Marca. We saw how Alaves did it and it is clear it can be done, but the circumstances are not the same. Barca boss Luis Enrique started Messi and Suarez on the bench for Alaves s visit to the Camp Nou after their duties in South American World Cup qualifying. Enrique won t make the same mistake twice, but could rotate in defence and midfield ahead of Wednesday s blockbuster La Liga clash with Atletico.Messi scored a hat-trick whilst Neymar bagged four assists and goal against Celtic as the MSN took their combined early season tally to 13.
