Ms Moepeng said, Botswana is a shining democracy today because its foundation is firmly anchored on respect for the rule of law, civil liberties and Botho, which Batswana are known for. Ms Moepeng highlighted that Botswana has been able to develop over the years because of continuity and good governance structures in place. There is continuity in what other leaders have done in the past and this ensured development as they implemented what the other had started and improved on where they left, she said.However, the UK s Telegraph newspaper in a piece titled 16 remarkable things you didn t know about Botswana says, President Khama was named Racist of the Year by Survival International.According to The Telegraph, The dubious distinction is given annually to the person displaying the greatest prejudice against tribal peoples . So what did Khama do? Well, according to Survival International, he has repeatedly called into question the legitimacy of the Bushmen s (Khoisan) existence and suggested they are lower down the evolutionary ladder than other people .
