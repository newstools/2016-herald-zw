Picture by Wilson KakuriraFungai Lupande Court ReporterNeville Mutsvangwa, who was facing allegations of raping a 43-year-old woman at his father s office in Harare was today acquitted.Harare magistrate Mr Hoseah Mujaya ruled that the complainant s evidence was poorly presented and exaggerated. To the police the complainant said she was penetrated twice but in court she said once, said Mr Mujaya. I cannot accept that she is illiterate that she cannot count to two. Can we shift the blame to the police? If at all the police wanted to make life easy for the accused then this was a poor attempt. He said there were contradictions on whether the accused removed the condom before the complainant was made to perform oral sex. The moment the rape victim becomes unreliable, the State case collapses. He is not guilty and hereby acquitted.
