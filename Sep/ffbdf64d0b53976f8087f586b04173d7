Firing someone from work after they have been exposed for being complicit in corporate malfeasance is not sufficient if what they stole cannot be recoveredLloyd Gumbo : Mr Speaker SirEarlier this week, The Herald carried a story where the board of Fidelity Printers and Refiners sued its former chief executive officer and finance director, Messrs Allen Marimbe and Godknows Hofisi respectively, after they allegedly clandestinely withdrew about $2,7 million from the firm s bank account. Marimbe, who was last year arrested facing fraud charges and money laundering involving about $2,7 million, refused to give a statement to the police on the grounds that most of his testimony was wrapped under the veil of the Official Secrets Act.The matter has since been suspended indefinitely.Mr Speaker Sir, it is understood that Marimbe s argument is that he did not convert the money to his personal use but gave it to some offices, which he could not divulge in a court of law.Ironically, in the summons, the board of Fidelity Printers and Refiners through their lawyers, indicated that the money had been non-procedurally withdrawn despite claims by Marimbe that the expenditure was covered under the Official Secrets Act.In the summons, the board said of Marimbe and Hofisi: They caused, participated in or suborned the illicit withdrawal of various amounts totalling the sum of US$2 669 146 from plaintiff s Bank Account held with Stanbic Bank. The amounts were withdrawn unprocedurally and for the benefit of no known recipient and or beneficiaries. The sums withdrawn were not put to the business of or used for the benefit of plaintiff or the people of Zimbabwe on whose behalf those funds were effectively held in trust. In conducting themselves in the manner aforestated, defendants caused pecuniary loss to plaintiff in the sum of $2 669 146 being the actual sum lost by plaintiff as a result of the breach by them of their obligations. Mr Speaker Sir, this is where the problem is that the accused claim that the usage of the money could not be divulged because it was covered under the Official Secrets Act yet the board was not aware of such transactions.Some people may claim that the board changed, but board resolutions approving such withdrawals should outlive individuals who come and go.If there is no documentation to prove that indeed the board approved such withdrawals then indeed it has every right to reclaim the money from the officials because there is a tendency by some officials in management to by-pass their respective boards when they want to engage in illicit dealings.This shows that the duo s actions were in contravention of Section 308 (1) and (2) that call on officials responsible for expenditure of public funds and those in control of public property to ensure public funds are safeguarded and spent on legally authorised purposes and amounts and to safeguard the property to ensure it s not lost, destroyed, damaged or misused.Subsection (4) further states that: An Act of Parliament must provide for the speedy detection of breaches of Subsections (2) and (3) and the disciplining and punishment of persons responsible for any such breaches and, where appropriate, the recovery of misappropriated funds or property. But in the event that indeed the money was clandestinely withdrawn to be given to some officials or offices without approval, then there are some lessons to be learnt.Firstly, authorities must not abuse State parastatals and enterprises by making them feeding troughs for a few individuals because whatever revenue they make or collect is for all Zimbabweans regardless of their status in society.The moment officials commandeer money from these organisations to satisfy personal needs then that becomes a serious problem because they will end up not contributing anything to the Treasury but a few individuals.Mr Speaker Sir, State parastatals and enterprises must be shielded from vultures who think that they have exclusive entitlement to revenue generated or collected by these organisations.If this is allowed to continue then we will forever be told about how the country lost billions of dollars from diamond sales while the country did not benefit much.Secondly, the moment Government authorities including ministers conspire with management at State parastatals and enterprises to clandestinely withdraw money and give it to them or their colleagues, they give these managers leeway to loot for themselves as well knowing that their superiors have no problem with looting.And when they start looting for themselves, these officials become untouchable knowing that their superiors would not raise their heads since they would have colluded with them before.So ministers or any other authority must know that the moment they order their subordinates to do something illegal, they are also giving the same officials ammunition to use when the former tries to raise their head.Once that happens, it becomes difficult to hold people to account.Thirdly, the decision by the Fidelity Printers and Refiners board to concurrently demand Marimbe and Hofisi to pay back the money they withdrew regardless of recipients of the same proceeds while the waiting for the criminal side to the matter at the High Court should be a template of how to protect public funds.Mr Speaker Sir, there are officials in management who have a tendency to steal in the name of higher offices but the manner in which the board handled this matter is putting pretenders to the sword.Yes, they may refuse to divulge information on their criminal charges for a week, month or years under the pretext of Official Secrets Act but the decision by the board to recover the money through civil proceedings is right on point.This is the only way public money or resources can be protected from vultures who think they are more important than the rest of citizens.Any cent that is generated in Zimbabwe is for every Zimbabwean whether they live in a dungeon or mansion.Fourthly, firing someone from work after they have been exposed for being complicit in corporate malfeasance is not sufficient if what they stole cannot be recovered.Feedback: [email&#160;protected]
