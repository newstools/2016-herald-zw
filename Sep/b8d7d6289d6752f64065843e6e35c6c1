 Tendai Rupapa Senior Court ReporterA bid by Harare man to gain the sympathy of the court by feigning hearing and speech impairment backfired after he was remanded in custody for two weeks to allow the court to provide a sign language interpreter.The prospects of returning to remand prison forced Joseph Tanyanyiwa (27) of 79 Jachi Street in Mbare, Harare, to change his mind and pleaded with the prison officers to return him to court to have his case finalised.After being brought back, he apologised for wasting the court s time.Tanyanyiwa first appeared in court two weeks ago facing charges of theft of trust property after pocketing $30 he had been given to buy an unnamed item.He appeared before Mrs Vongai Muchuchuti-Guwuriro and when the charge was put to him, the court asked if he understood but he remained mum.Tanyanyiwa used his hands to tell the court that he could neither hear nor speak.He was then remanded in custody to last Thursday and the State was ordered to secure the services of a sign language interpreter.When he came back to court on Thursday, he still pretended to be living with hearing and speech impairments and the court asked the State if the interpreter was in attendance but prosecutor Ms Nancy Chandakaona advised the court that the interpreter would only be available after 14 working days.She then produced a letter addressed to the chief interpreter in which she was requesting for the said inter- preter. We kindly request your office to facilitate the services of a sign language interpreter for the above case. The trial is set for September 15 , read part of the letter.Tanyanyiwa was then remanded in custody to another date pending the availability of the interpreter and was taken back to the court holding cells.However, Tanyanyiwa could not bear the thought of being in custody for two more weeks and notified the prison guard that he wanted to go back in court. He was brought back and apologised to the court for his behaviour.He, however, left the court in stitches when he said he had tonsils hence was unable to speak.Mrs Muchuchuti-Guwuriro sentenced him to two months in prison which were wholly suspended on condition he restitutes $30 to Happson Wasiyanyika.On September 9, Wasiyanyika, whose mobile phone had developed a fault, approached Tanyanyiwa who is in the business of repairing phones.Wasiyanyika was advised by Tanyanyiwa that his cellphone needed a new LCD and was given $30 to buy the LCD.He then converted the money to his personal use.
