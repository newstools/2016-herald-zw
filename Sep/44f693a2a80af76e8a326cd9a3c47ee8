Collin Matiza : Sports EditorMOTOR racing just runs in the Whyte family. After having watched his father Jamie Whyte winning back-to-back African motor rally titles as a teenager in 2009 and 2010, young Rowan Whyte followed in his dad s footsteps and took up the sport, concentrating in main circuit racing at Donnybrook in Harare. And just like his father, Rowan (26) was at the weekend crowned a motor racing champion for the second time in his career when he won this year s Saloon A Open Class with one round to spare. His first title came in 2014 when he was competing in the same class in a Subaru.Rowan drove the same car to victory once again this year in the seven-round national championship series and was yesterday over the moon after his latest achievement. Yeah, it was just brilliant to win this year s Saloon A Open Class and special mention (goes) to my dad (Jamie) for preparing and maintaining the car; and also thanks to Motul Zimbabwe for the sponsorship of the oil. But a big thank you goes to TT Motorcycles of Harare who were my main sponsors. This is the second national title that I ve won in my career as a motor racing driver and just feels so good, an excited Rowan said.Racing under Team Jialing, Rowan amassed 88 points to walk away with this year s title in the Saloon A Open Class, beating seasoned drivers such as Eric Heard, Barney Rogers and Farnie van de Linde in the process to crown a memorable year for himself. One of his major sponsors, Motul Zimbabwe, were among the first people to congratulate him after he clinched the title in Bulawayo at the weekend. Motul in Zimbabwe would like to give a big congratulations to #TeamJialing #JialingRacing for winning the Zimbabwe National Car Circuit 2016 championship. Great racing from Rowan James Whyte &amp; (his) team this season, clinching the championship with just one race to go!
