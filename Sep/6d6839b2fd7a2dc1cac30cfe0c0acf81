BERLIN. Champions Bayern Munich came from a goal down at home to defeat Ingolstadt 04 3-1 in the German Bundesliga on Saturday while Gonzalo Castro struck twice as Borussia Dortmund thumped Darmstadt 98 6-0. Adrian Ramos, American teenager Christian Pulisic, Sebastian Rode and Emre Mor also scored for Dortmund who are fourth in the table on six points.Darmstadt went down to 10 men in the 57th minute after Peter Niemeyer was sent off for a second caution.Bayern were far less convincing than in their 5-0 Champions League victory over Russian team Rostov on Tuesday and were caught napping after eight minutes when Paraguayan Dario Lezcano slipped the ball through the legs of keeper Manuel Neuer.It took four minutes for Bayern to level as Poland striker Robert Lewandowski chipped the ball beautifully over the Ingolstadt keeper for his fifth league goal of the campaign.Xabi Alonso s low drive from 20 metres put Bayern ahead but they were lucky not to concede an equaliser before Rafinha drilled in their third goal from the edge of the box in the 84th minute.
