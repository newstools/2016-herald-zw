WELLINGTON. New Zealand rugby officials yesterday terminated the contract of a teenage star who viciously assaulted four people including two women, following a public outcry after he escaped conviction. After initially supporting winger Losi Filipo, rugby administrators performed a U-turn following a heated reaction that even saw Prime Minister John Key drawn into the debate.Filipo (18) dodged conviction because a judge said he did not want to derail his career, sparking accusations the court system in rugby-mad New Zealand gives sports stars special treatment. If it was anyone else on the street, they wouldn t be let off for any of this for attacking four of us punching two females, Kelsey Odell, one of his victims, told TV3.Key also weighed in, telling reporters: Violence is unacceptable anywhere, it doesn t matter what your profession. New Zealand Rugby (NZR), which was criticised last month over its handling of sexual assault allegations against Waikato Chiefs players, had argued that Filipo was dealt with by the court system and should not be shunned. We believe young men, like Losi, are better off with rugby in their lives, NZR chief Steve Tew said in a statement early yesterday. AFP.
