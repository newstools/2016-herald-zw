Faith Mutema : Sports ReporterMAMELODI Sundowns talisman, Khama Billiat, has revealed he faces a demanding six months as he braces for appearances in the Champions League and the African Cup of Nations finals. Billiat and his Brazilians will be hoping to overturn a 1-2 first leg deficit when they meet Zambian side Zesco United this weekend. The Zimbabwean ace told Kick-Off he was hoping he will not pick a serious injury in the coming weeks and months. It is stressing because these months are crucial for me, but I am focusing on a plan not to (get) any injuries on my body. Right now I am concentrating on the Champions League because this is a big time for me. I ve never been to this stage of the competition before and if I enjoy my football now it will bring better performances come January and the Nations Cup. I want to be in better form than I am now as it will be the biggest stage that I have ever played at for my national team which could open other opportunities for me, said Billiat.
