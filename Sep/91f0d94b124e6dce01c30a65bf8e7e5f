Hello to all our O-Level candidates for 2015. Some of you are writing in June whilst the bulk are writing in November. I am here to give you some handy hints on how to come out with a straight A in your Zimsec O-Levels. This week we will start of with general tips and in the following months proceed to more technical ideas.The Guide to Zimsec English# Buy a dictionary for word meaning and spelling.# Buy the Zimsec Green Book for revision.# Avoid purchasing the pirated version from the street which may have errors because it is not the original.# This also promotes the defrauding of Zimsec through infringement of copyright.# English language revision is made up of practice work in text books such as Step Ahead Book 3 by Shimmer Chinodya which has excellent remedial exercises.# Do past papers by yourself.# Mark the past papers yourself.# Do not register to write in June if you struggle with English.# Writing in June cuts short your revision time.# Write in November so that your mocks give you an idea of where you need to improve.# Take English extra lessons.# One on one lessons are better than those in a class set up.# Lessons in a small group are also an advantage.# Ensure that teachers for remedial lessons have the correct qualifications and teach at a regular formal school.# Beware of bogus teachers who have never seen the door of a teacher s college but are totally clueless and want to make a quick buck.# Join the local library and read widely to build good vocabulary and composition skills.# Spent hours usually used on activities such as social networking to read the newspaper,magazines and novels to improve spelling,grammar,sentence construction,vocabulary and composition.# Do all given homework unless you plan to fail.# Know the English Language syllabus.# Currently, Paper One is Free Composition in Section A and Guided Composition in Section B.# Paper two which is now marked by computer is made up of comprehension and summary in Section A and Register in Section B.# Know how to master the skills required in each section.# If registered to write as an external student make sure that the college involved has it s house in order.# Practise your English by taking part in activities that help improve your writing.E.g Write a letter to a rural friend or family member using snail mail.Write a book review.Write a speech for a school function.Write a report for your club or sport.Write an article for the school magazine.Write a short story for the school publication.# Make your dictionary your best friend.# Write as many past papers as you can.# If you are a repeat student who keeps getting D s while studying alone it s time to get the help of a teacher or that D will never change.# Time yourself as you write past papers.# Paper One is one and a half hours,Paper Two is two hours.# Find someone to mark your essays.# Work hard to pass your English because it is a mandatory requirement for proceeding to A Level.Lastly for all O-Level school children residing in the following areas Greencroft, Mabelreign, Avondale West, Sunridge, Westgate, Marlborough and Emerald Hill contact The Language Coach to find out more about the new centre for English Language Remediation which is producing excellent results in that area.The Language Coach is a qualified English Language teacher with a BA General degree in English.
