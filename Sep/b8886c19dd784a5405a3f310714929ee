Herald ReporterTWO new radio stations belonging to Kingstons Enterprises, have gone live in Harare and Kariba. This follows the granting of two commercial broadcasting licences for the two locations by the Broadcasting Authority of Zimbabwe. Capitalk Radio, formerly KE100.4FM, which will be broadcasting in Harare had its signal activated on Tuesday while NyamiNyami FM (frequency 94.5FM), which will be broadcasting in Kariba went live on Thursday.Both stations are currently playing music while the signal is being improved.However, the stations will have different programming formats once they are fully launched.Kingstons Enterprises acting chief executive officer Mr Farai Ruziva, said Capitalk Radio would have a vibrant and exciting news/talk format focusing mostly on all issues affecting the country s capital city while NyamiNyami FM would have full spectrum programming with an emphasis on music and general hyper-localised content from the Mashonaland West town, as that was the catchment area for the station.Mr Ruziva said Harare had been struggling with issues of poor service delivery in recent years and the Harare station would look at such issues in greater detail.In Kariba, he said, the whole thrust was to ensure that new talent from the town would have a chance to make names for themselves in broadcasting. We are actively looking for local talent to work at the station and we are engaging with Kariba town stakeholders in Nyamhunga, BaTonga, Mahombekombe and other areas to secure buy-in and crucial support for what we know will be the most exciting thing to happen to the town since the beginning of construction of Kariba Dam in 1955, Mr Ruziva said.Kariba is a tourist destination of note with domestic and foreign visitors spending dollars to view the Kariba Dam wall and enjoy the many attractions that the town has to offer.
