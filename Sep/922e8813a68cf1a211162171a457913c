BERLIN Bayern Munich turn their focus from their five-star Champions League soccer opener to domestic duty and their bid to keep their perfect start to the season in a derby home to Ingolstadt today. The reigning Bundesliga champions hammered Russian side Rostov 5-0 in Munich in their Group D opener to continue Carlo Ancelotti s impressive start to life in Germany with five wins from five matches, 20 goals scored and none conceded. Fellow Bavarian outfit Ingolstadt are 16th after two games, with one point, and rank outsiders to spring an upset. Coach Markus Kauczinski insists his side won t be overawed in the Allianz Arena, where they will be without French defender Romain Bregerie, who has been hit by a calf injury. We have nothing to lose, he said. We know that everything has to be perfect on Saturday to bring something back. But we re not going to hide and we re going to remain true to our style of play. The match is the first of two at home for Bayern, who could be alone on top of the table by the end of September after Ingolstadt they host Hertha Berlin, the only other unbeaten team after two rounds.
