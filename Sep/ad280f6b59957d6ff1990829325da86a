Mr ChidemeBianca Leboho Herald Reporter Harare City Council will shut down Morton Jaffray Water Treatment plant over the weekend to allow for final refurbishment before the onset of the rainy season. This is set to be the last shutdown of the water treatment plant before the onset of the rains.In a statement yesterday, council spokesperson Mr Michael Chideme said the shutdown would allow the final stages of the refurbishment of Morton Jaffray to be completed before the beginning of the rain season. Harare City Council advises its esteemed water customers of the last complete shutdown of the Morton Jaffray Water Treatment Plant before the onset of the rain season on Saturday 3 September to Sunday 4 September, 2016, said Mr Chideme.He further advised residents to store enough water for use during the dry weekend. Seventy percent of the installations currently underway at Morton Jaffray Water Plant have already been completed. We expect to complete the on-going installation of new plant and equipment under the Morton Jaffray renewal programme during the shutdown. The main aim of the renewal programme underway at Morton Jaffray is to improve water delivery and availability in the city. Morton Jaffray Water Plant supplies and delivers water to the greater part of Harare whilst other parts of the city rely on Prince Edward Water Treatment Plant.The city, however, recently expressed concern over the shrinking supply of water in Harare with the dam supplying Prince Edward reported to be almost dry.Mr Chideme recently confirmed that despite the inroads being made at Morton Jaffray with the current refurbishment of the water treatment plant, the city might still not be able to supply a continuously growing Harare.
