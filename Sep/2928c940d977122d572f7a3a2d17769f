LONDON. One Arsenal player privately messaged Jose Mourinho to reveal that Arsene Wenger did nothing in training sessions before a 2-0 win over Manchester City, according to a new biography about the Manchester United manager. In January 2015, goals from Santi Cazorla and Olivier Giroud sealed a victory at the Etihad Stadium, ending City s run of 12 games unbeaten.But in a new biography Jose Mourinho: Up close and personal by Rob Beasley, which is being serialised by The Daily Mail, it s claimed that an unnamed Arsenal star was in contact with Mourinho, who went on to win the English Premier League title with Chelsea that season, and told the Portuguese that Wenger s players were figuring out their own tactics ahead of their win over City. Later in the 2014 15 season there was more astonishing stuff from Jose after Chelsea won 5 0 at Swansea. When I congratulated Mourinho he was already looking forward to the next day s clash between Manchester City and Arsenal, Beasley wrote. He declared: Yes was good, now let s see s*** Arsenal. We were both convinced City would win but Arsenal won 2 0. I told Jose they d actually done a Chelsea and copied his game plan from a year ago and his emailed response left me gobsmacked. First he joked: Mr Wenger gets new 5 years contract but then he claimed (One of the Arsenal players) sent me an SMS to say players did themselves, organised themselves during the week. Wenger did nothing. When I expressed my amazement he replied that his information was 100 per cent . Meanwhile, Mourinho plotted a move for Arsenal s Theo Walcott and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain in retaliation for them signing Petr Cech in 2015, according to claims in a new book.The 34-year-old spent 11 successful years at Chelsea but lost his place in the starting XI to Thibaut Courtois leading to a 10million transfer to the Emirates.Mourinho later revealed it was not his decision to let Cech leave to join a rival.
