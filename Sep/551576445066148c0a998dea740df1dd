Jah Prayzah and Oliver MtukudziArts ReporterThe much-awaited party to celebrate Oliver Mtukudzi s new album Eheka! Nhai Yahwe is on tonight at Borrowdale Country Manor. The album launch will feature other performers Jah Prayzah, Tariro neGitare and Sam Dondo. Tuku unveiled the album at Pakare Paye Arts Centre last week at a function that coincided with his birthday. During the private function, the musician said September has been his month to celebrate over the past years and he is glad to host the party.He said fans who attend tonight s Borrowdale Manor show should expect a memorable event.Organisers of the gig said they have made a set-up that is conducive for corporate and family entertainment.Event Organiser Thompson Dondo of D&amp;G Events said taking the album launch to Borrowdale Country Manor was a way of welcoming Tuku s album in an exquisite way. This is not an ordinary launch. Yes, mudhara Tuku has done other upmarket gigs, but this launch will surpass all of them because we want to make a strong statement about his brand, said Dondo. This is a musician who has represented the country at various stages across the world and has worked with most of the big companies in the country. We want to honour that big brand with a classy affair where chief executives can come and enjoy his music away from the mass market. Although we will also have general music followers that want to experience such ambiance, we are giving this opportunity to the executives that only see Tuku at their corporate functions. This show is a chance for them to go for a night out and still feel as if they are at a corporate function. The difference is that at this show they will dance and make merry without any formalities or protocol because Tuku is saying enjoy my dear friends .
