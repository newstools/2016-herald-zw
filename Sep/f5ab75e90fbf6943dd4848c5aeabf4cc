Ellina Mhlanga Sports Reporter OLYMPIAN Wirimai Juwawo yesterday emerged victorious in the Old Mutual Westgate half-marathon as he proved his dominance on the local scene.Juwawo was the first to cross the finish line in 1hour 4minutes 4seconds, followed by fellow Olympian Cuthbert Nyasango with a time of 1 hour 4 minutes 7 seconds. Both Juwawo and Nyasango were at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games last month. This is the second time Juwawo has won the race and the Black Rhinos Athletics Club athlete could not hide his joy. I am happy because it has been long since I finished in the top three of this race. So winning it s a great bonus. I won it in 2012 after I had just returned from the London Olympic Games, so I am happy I won it after four years. And again I am just coming from the Olympics. I don t know maybe competing at the Olympics makes me win this race, said Juwawo.The seasoned long-distance runner walked away with $3 000 and said yesterday s victory was a relief after finding the going tough at the Olympics.
