Manchester United forwards Wayne Rooney and Zlatan Ibrahimovic react with dismay as they slump to defeat at Watford yesterday. DailyMailLondon. Watford piled on the misery for Jose Mourinho as Manchester United crashed to a third successive defeat in an embarrassing 3-1 loss at Vicarage Road while Tottenham Hotspur went third after beating Sunderland 1-0 with a goal from Harry Kane, who later limped off yesterday. Mourinho s side were rocked by Etienne Capoue s first half opener and, although Marcus Rashford equalised after the break, United capitulated in the closing stages.Juan Camilo Zuniga restored Watford s lead with seven minutes left before Troy Deeney s penalty condemned Mourinho to a third consecutive defeat for the first time since he was in charge at Porto in 2002.It was the first time United had lost three in a row since the unlamented Louis van Gaal presided over four successive defeats in December last year.Adding to the indignity for United, it was their first loss in 30 years against Watford, who ended a run of 11 successive defeats against the Manchester giants.United are already lagging six points behind Premier League leaders Manchester City and the feel-good factor following the three wins that marked the start of the Mourinho era has been completely erased.After losing to City, Feyenoord in the Europa League and now Watford over the last week, the size of the task facing Mourinho as he rebuilds United has been laid bare. I feel the first moment we had a defeat, a difficult situation, some of the boys are having a bit of difficulty coping with the negativity, Mourinho said.They looked out of sync from the moment United goalkeeper David de Gea collided with Chris Smalling as they made a hash of dealing with Sebastian Prodl s towering cross.When de Gea dropped the ball straight to Odion Ighalo a goal seemed certain, but the Watford striker fired hurriedly wide of the unguarded net from the edge of the penalty area.It was a shocking miss, but even that escape couldn t shake United from their lethargy and de Gea had to throw himself to his left to claw away a goalbound header from Deeney moments later.Paul Pogba has struggled to live up his world record fee since joining United and, amid another tepid display, the France midfielder gave a sudden glimpse of his ability when he quickly shifted the ball to set himself for a curling 25-yard strike that left Watford goalkeeper Heurelho Gomes rooted to the spot as it cannoned off the crossbar.But Watford s relentlessly physical approach was wearing United down and Anthony Martial needed several minutes treatment after being pole-axed by a clash of heads with Daryl Janmaat.Martial eventually got to his feet but the France international still appeared groggy when he was made a fatal mistake in the 34th minute.Dwelling too long on the ball deep inside his own half, Martial was caught in possession by Miguel Britos and, with United s defence completely exposed, Janmaat had time and space to pick out the unmarked Capoue, who drilled a clinical finish past de Gea.As Watford celebrated, Mourinho questioned whether Martial had been fouled and the winger lay flat on the turf before being substituted.Meanwhile, Charlie Austin came off the bench to give Southampton their first Premier League win of the season by scoring in a 1-0 win over Swansea at St Mary s yesterday.It was the south coast club s first Premier League success under manager Claude Puel and their second victory in a week under the Frenchman after the team s Europa League win over Sparta Prague.In another match played yesterday, Crystal Palace inflicted a crushing 4-1 defeat upon winless Stoke City in the Premier League.Townsend set up the opening goal for James Tomkins at Selhurst Park and completed the scoring with his first Palace goal after Scott Dann and James McArthur had also got on the score-sheet.It gave Alan Pardew s side consecutive league wins for the first time since last December and saw the south London club climb to eighth place in the table.
