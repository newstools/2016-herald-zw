Farmers are also encouraged to produce their own stock feed and practice sustainable water usage to improve pasturesEnacy Mapakame : Business ReporterZIMBABWE is importing three million litres of milk a month to cover for the shortfall in national production, industry experts say Monthly dairy monthly production is currently at five million litres against a national demand of eight million litres, leaving imports to cover the balance. However, a dairy revitalisation programme, being implemented by Government and its partners under the Private Public Partnerships is expected to reduce the level of imports within the next two years.The dairy revitalisation programme envisages a record annual milk production of 77 million litres in the next two years following the addition of 400 heifers to the national herd.The programme is aimed at improving local production and cut on imports on milk and other dairy products.Dairy revitalisation committee chairman Mr Emmanuel Zimbandu said while production was still short of national demand, there is impetus from industry players to meet national demand on full implementation of the dairy revitalisation programme. Current capacity enables us to produce five million litres of milk a month against a demand of eight million litres on a monthly basis. This programme (DRP) should enable us to be self sufficient. Eventually we should be able to meet national demand and cut on milk imports, said Mr Zimbandu.Under the DRP, small scale farmers will be capacitated and graduate into medium scale producers of milk.In line with this, 90 percent of the total recipients of the 400 imported heifers, already in the country will be small scale farmers. There are 1 000 small scale dairy farmers in the country.A total of 93 dairy farmers will benefit from the heifer programme, whose official hand over ceremony is expected on September 29, in Marondera.Current national herd is 29 000 cows which produce an estimated 61 million litres annually. Industry players are confident the national herd will improve to 33 000 cows with an annual production of 77 million litres by 2018.Last year, national demand for milk was between nine million litres and 10 million litres a month but reduced to eight million litres as consumers shift the product mix to lower margin basics on low disposable incomes.The economic environment is currently characterised by liquidity constraints, low consumer spend, deflation, and stiff competition from imports with value offerings.Like other sectors of the economy, dairy farmers have cited cost of production and the unavailability of long term funding as one of the key factors limiting their competitiveness.But the DRP is expected to address such challenges and enhance the sector s efficiency, improve productivity and contribution to economic growth.Under the programme, farmers are also encouraged to produce their own stock feed and practice sustainable water usage to improve pastures. Milk is a volumes business, we want to increase local production through herd improvement and quality necessary for good yields, said Mr Zimbandu.
