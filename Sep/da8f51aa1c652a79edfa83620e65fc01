BERLIN. Carlo Ancelotti s all-conquering German league leaders Bayern Munich face a Hamburg side in turmoil today with coach Bruno Labbadia under the threat of the axe after three straight defeats. Hamburg s 1-0 defeat at Freiburg on Tuesday followed their humiliating 4-0 drubbing at home to RB Leipzig last Saturday.Labbadia has been in charge since April 2015 but another uninspiring performance from his team at the hands of Ancelotti s relentless Bayern could be his last.It does not help that Hamburg have suffered 5-0, 8-0 and 9-2 thrashings at the hands of the Munich giants in the last three years and another drubbing could see Labbadia shown the door just five games into the new league season.Hamburg last beat Bayern in 2009 and are winless against the Bavarian giants in their last 13 games. I take the main responsibility and I m the first to do so if we can t decide games for ourselves, said Labbadia after their latest reversal.Hamburg s defence will need to dramatically improve against Bayern s strike force boasting Robert Lewandowski, Thomas Mueller and Franck Ribery, who netted in Wednesday s 3-0 win at home to Hertha Berlin.Bayern are the only team with a perfect record in Germany s top flight. They want an impressive display before next Wednesday s Champions League group stage clash at Atletico Madrid, who knocked them out in the semi-finals last year.With seven wins from his first seven games in all competitions, Ancelotti is enjoying the best start to a season in Bayern s highly successful history.
