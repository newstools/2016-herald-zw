Your history in the organisation is characterised by discipline and hard work. As a result it comes as no surprise to anyone that the Commander-in-Chief has found it necessary to promote you, he said. We are going through difficult economic times and as a result your subordinates will be having challenges and frustrations emanating from scarcity of basic needs and as a leader, you will have to commiserate, council and provide them with leadership. It s your duty to ensure they have high moral all the time which calls for innovativeness and creativity, said Air Marshal Shiri.&nbsp;
