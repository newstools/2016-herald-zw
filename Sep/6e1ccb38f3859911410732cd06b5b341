PARIS. Andre Schuerrle smashed in a late equaliser as Borussia Dortmund held Real Madrid in the Champions League soccer on Tuesday night, while Leicester City claimed another famous European victory. English Premier League champions Leicester made it two wins from two in their debut Champions League campaign as Islam Slimani s first-half goal secured a 1-0 win against FC Porto, and it was a good night all round for English clubs as Tottenham Hotspur beat CSKA Moscow in Russia. Reigning champions Real twice surrendered the lead as they settled for a 2-2 draw against Dortmund to extend their poor record on German soil.In a tremendous Group F game played at breathless pace, Zinedine Zidane s side went in front in the 17th minute when Gareth Bale s back-heel came off Matthias Ginter and fell for Cristiano Ronaldo to fire home.It was the Portuguese superstar s 98th European goal but Dortmund had been in fearsome form ahead of this showdown and they drew level just before the interval.Making his first appearance of the season after injury, Real goalkeeper Keylor Navas opted to punch a Raphael Guerreiro free-kick and the ball struck the face of his team-mate Raphael Varane before rebounding into the net.Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang was standing in close quarters, and he was officially credited with the goal by UEFA.However, French centre-back Varane made up for that by restoring Real s advantage midway through the second half, following in to score after Karim Benzema s attempt had hit both the post and bar.But there was to be no first win in Dortmund for Real as substitute Schuerrle rifled a shot into the roof of the net after a Christian Pulisic cross fell to him on the edge of the box. I am gutted for the players, we didn t deserve that. In the end it s not a bad result but, playing like that, gutted, said Zidane.Madrid have won just four times in 30 away games against German clubs but this result still leaves them in control of Group F. In the other game in the section, first- half goals by Bryan Ruiz and Bas Dost gave Sporting a 2-0 victory against Legia Warsaw in Portugal.Leicester have maximum points after two matches in Group G after edging out two-time European champions Porto at the King Power Stadium.
