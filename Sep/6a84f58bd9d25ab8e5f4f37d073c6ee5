Sports ReporterMINISTER of Sport and Recreation Makhosini Hlongwane yesterday met with the Ambassador of Pakistan, Asaf Khan to exchange views on sport issues. The two met at Hlongwane s offices where they shared their views on possible areas of co-operation to strengthen the friendship between the two countries in sport and beyond. Hlongwane noted that while Zimbabwe have continued to benefit in terms of cricket they would also want to explore other areas such as hockey. I must state that we have over the years reliably relied on Pakistan for support in the evolving matrix of global cricket management and design and we are very appreciative to the Pakistan government, Pakistani people and the Pakistan cricket board for that kind gesture. We also support that cricket should be played in Pakistan as a Ministry of Sport. We think that Pakistan is an important actor and in terms of the global cricket development and we want that, that the good relations in respect of that particular area continue. Zimbabwe has not been doing very well as you know . . . and there are opportunities for the development of cricket for Zimbabwe in this relationship including the fact that we could have exchange programmes. The second most important thing, is we admire the development of hockey in Pakistan. The Pakistan government has invested a lot in the development of hockey in your country and we think that we have some lessons to learn in that trajectory, said Hlongwane.On the proposals by Hlongwane, Khan concurred. So my effort will now be to get in touch with the right people in Pakistan and to convey your message and to convey your feelings and your desire, that we should have more cooperation through sports, said Khan.Last year Zimbabwe became the first nation in six years to tour Pakistan since the Sri Lanka team was attacked by terrorists during a tour in 2009.In regard to that, the Pakistan Ambassador, Khan said they are grateful to Zimbabwe.
