LONDON Arsenal are prepared to listen to offers for Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain in the coming months despite the fact the England midfielder has insisted he doesn t want to leave the club. Arsenal were open to selling Oxlade-Chamberlain this summer, although the England midfielder said that he did not want to leave, and now the club is making him wait on a new contract. Oxlade-Chamberlain is in the penultimate year of his current deal and finds his Arsenal career at a crossroads. He is still determined to make a success of it there, five years after joining from Southampton. But time is running out.It was another frustrating night for Oxlade-Chamberlain on Tuesday, in their 1-1 draw with Paris Saint Germain. Selected after a late injury to Theo Walcott, he was a peripheral figure, as Arsenal struggled to gain any foothold in midfield. He was substituted for Olivier Giroud after an hour.The same thing happened four days before, in Arsenal s 2-1 win over former club Southampton, when Oxlade-Chamberlain was disappointed to be taken off after 63 minutes. Oxlade-Chamberlain has started four Arsenal games this season and is yet to make it through to the 80th minute of a match in any of them. The Independent.&nbsp;
