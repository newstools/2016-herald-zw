Elina Mhlanga: Sports ReporterTENNIS Zimbabwe are now expected to hold their elections at a special general meeting on October 8 at Harare Sports Club following the submission of nominees by the provinces. The elections were initially set for August 27 during the association s general meeting but there were no nominations. The association has been under the leadership of Regis Bhunu, deputised by Martin Lock. The other members of the outgoing executive are treasurer Tongesai Zvaravanhu, Biggie Magarira, John Nyashanu, Tendai Mutseyekwa and Brian Chirimumimba.All posts are up for grabs. Bhunu, yesterday said everything is on course after the provinces submitted their nominees. The elections are on October 8 and now provinces have responded accordingly, giving indications of people they want in office. So we expect to have a new Tennis Zimbabwe president on October 8. Normally nomination should come in 14 days before the day of elections and this time we received nominations unlike last time when we did not get nominations. We had our annual general meeting but when we called for provinces to bring nominations they did not nominate, said Bhunu.The outgoing president said he is not seeking re-election because of other pressing commitments. I have given enough. I have more pressure of my work. I felt that I will not be the best person to push this thing. I could see that my time allocation was becoming less and less and it will affect the national association, said Bhunu.Bhunu, who last month revealed that the national association was considering returning to the Fed Cup said they are still working on securing sponsorship before they can apply for participation. It s work in progress. It s to do with sponsorship, we are still trying to find a taker. The moment we have that we can take-off. They (International Tennis Federation) know that we are trying to come back but we can only apply once we get sponsorship, said Bhunu.
