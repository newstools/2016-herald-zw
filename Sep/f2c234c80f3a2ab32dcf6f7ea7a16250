LONDON. Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho should be aware of his treatment of young players, according to former Manchester City defender Stuart Pearce. United slumped to a third consecutive defeat under the Portuguese on Sunday, losing 3-1 to Watford at Vicarage Road. Mourinho then raised eyebrows by singling out defender Luke Shaw for criticism, despite Wayne Rooney, Paul Pogba and Eric Bailly also struggling on a chastening afternoon for the Red Devils.It came just a week after Mourinho aimed sly digs at Jesse Lingard and Henrikh Mhkhitaryan, talking about some really poor individual performances after their 2-1 derby defeat to rivals Manchester City.And Pearce believes Mourinho should adopt a softer approach when criticising the younger players of the squad. He looked at Lingard after the derby game and said it was too much for him, Pearce told Sky Sports. He blamed Luke Shaw for the second goal (against Watford). You think he s probably better off not having a pop at the youngsters. What he needs to do is probably pull [Shaw] aside, get him in front of a video and educate him on how to play the game. It s difficult for me to tell Mourinho how to coach and educate he s the best in the world at it. Mourinho has been questioned in the past for his willingness to go public with his criticism of players.During his turbulent second spell at Chelsea, the Portuguese boss didn t hold back in blasting the likes of Eden Hazard, Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas.Mourinho laid into Shaw after Manchester United crashed to their third defeat in eight days on Sunday.The United boss singled out the England defender for blame claiming he was badly at fault for Watford s second goal and had not learned from his past mistakes.Left-back Shaw was given a touchline lecture as he was substituted straight after Juan Zuniga had put the Hornets in front in the 82nd minute.
