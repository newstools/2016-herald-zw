PRETORIA Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane has warned those calling for Keagan Dolly to move overseas that he is not yet ready. Dolly has not been able to maintain the same level of performance he was at towards the end of last season, according to his club coach. The former South Africa Under-23 captain did, however, make an extremely important contribution that led to the away goal against Zesco United in the CAF Champions League tomorrow.In the final minutes of that game, Dolly found the energy to quickly close down a Zesco player in midfield to win the ball deep in Sundowns half.He then eliminated two players with a Lionel Messi-style surge through the middle on a quick counter-attack before playing it wide to Anthony Laffor, who was in space to set up goalscorer Khama Billiat.It is these types of moments that separate great players from good players, and Mosimane believes the 23-year-old will get there eventually once he can become more consistent. Keagan, the ball was not falling for him (against Chippa United last night), it was not flowing, Mosimane said on SuperSport. He s not been playing very well in the last two games, even in Zambia, but I told him this happens, it s part of football, he s young, he must also understand. And this is what he learns before everybody must speak about Keagan playing overseas and giving him that kind of overseas (move) when he s not yet ready. He needs a little bit of time because you need to be able to be deal with this before you go overseas. Great player, great player, no doubt about it, he s helped us a lot but it s a learning curve also for everybody who s making a lot of noise that Keagan must go overseas. Quality player, he needs some time. Kick-Off.
