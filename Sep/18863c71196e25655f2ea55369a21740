Chipo MtasaConrad Mwanawashe and Melody MashaireA few years ago, no one could have predicted that Zimbabwean companies could be banking on online revenues to drive business. However, with the growth in mobile and internet penetration rates not only in Zimbabwe but around the world the online business has become attractive to corporates that have for a long time been laid back in embracing new internet developments. Business has gone tech-savvy given that customers now want services that are real time, on demand and social, according to TelOne managing director Chipo Mtasa.Mrs Mtasa was speaking at the launch of the company s new interactive site and mobile application yesterday.She believes that its online business could grow revenues and collections for TelOne judging by the increase in transactions the company registered in the six months the online platforms have been live. You may want to know that in the six months that TelOne online platforms have been live, transactions worth $4 million have been facilitated, she said.Actually, the company expects growth in transaction volumes following the unveiling of the mobile application that will see its customers accessing TelOne where ever they are.The telecommunications company hopes to take advantage of the growth in mobile and internet penetration in Zimbabwe.According to the Postal and Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe mobile penetration increased in the last quarter of 2015 to 95,4 percent from 92,8 percent in the previous quarter.During the same quarter, internet penetration rose to 48,1 percent in as active internet subscriptions increased to 6 575 591. We have made it our mission to show how we can leverage on the new technology to improve the performance of the business. Given the trends we have seen since the going live of the TelOne online payment platforms, we are confident that the new user friendly website and mobile application will again improve revenues and collections. TelOne will continue to push through its drive to dominate the digital space and hopes to have a presence in every part of the country in four years time. These touch points are in line with our vision of connecting everyone, everywhere in Zimbabwe by 2020 by making us more accessible to customers, increasing conversations with them and empowering them through the self service enabled portal, she said. With a number of network expansion and mordenisation projects lined up, we will ensure that our customers and stakeholders will be kept updated on the new developments as well as our products and services including promotions through these two platforms, Mrs Mtasa said.
