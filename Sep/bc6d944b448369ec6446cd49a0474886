Court CorrespondentThe trial of an Indian woman and her son, accused of selling her late husband s business which was part of an unregistered estate, started on Monday with the pair pleading not guilty. Nighert Parween Savania (62) and her son Deen Savania (33) were facing fraud charges when they appeared before Harare magistrate Ms Tendai Rusinahama. The complainant, Nathan Munaba, bought the business in 2012.They both pleaded not guilty. The complainant has suffered no prejudice at all (actual or potential) by virtue of the fact that he is in effective control of all the shares he bought in terms of the aforesaid agreement of sale of shares and is in occupation of the sole asset of the company. These are trumped up and baseless allegations that have been brought at the instance of the person who knows that though his claim is at the very best civil in nature, reads the duo s defence outline.The court heard that Savania is the widow of the late Mahendra Savania, who was the director of Norwhich Trading Company.
