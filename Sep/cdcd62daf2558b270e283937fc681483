Faith Mutema and Margaret MatibiriTwo MDC-T legislators and 12 other party activists were on Tuesday granted $400 bail each for engaging in unlawful demonstrations in a case in which the magistrate castigated social media users for interfering with the court process. The two MDC-T legislators are Ronia Bunjira and Fani Munengami The magistrate Mr Stanford Mambanje sternly warned those who are abusing social media against interfering with judicial independence for political mileage. The court finds it in bad taste that people are abusing social media, when the case is still pending before this court. Someone is throwing spanners into the work of the court by throwing political connotations using social media, said Mr Mambanje This unconstructive system is undesirable and trying to interfere with the judicial system is not acceptable, allow the court to do its work without interference.&nbsp;
