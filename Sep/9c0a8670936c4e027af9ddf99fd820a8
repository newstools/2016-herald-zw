RioZim Ltd chose a state-owned Chinese company to design a $2,1 billion power plant it plans to build in Zimbabwe and is lobbying South Africa s electricity utility to buy from the facility to help attract investors. State Nuclear Electric Power Planning Design and Research Institute, based in Beijing, has already come in to design the generators for the 2 800-megawatt coal-fired Sengwa plant, RioZim non-executive director Caleb Dengu said.RioZim has written to South African Energy Minister Tina Joemat-Pettersson asking that Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd buy 2 000 megawatts, he said.Zimbabwe rations power daily, producing and importing about 1 300 megawatts against demand of about 2 200 megawatts.RioZim is working on raising funds through equity and debt for the facility, chief executive officer Noah Matimba said in May last year.Of the $2,1 billion needed for the plant, $50 million will be for a coal mine that will supply the station. There are some companies from Dubai which are interested, we have from South Africa which are interested, but they all have conditions which some of them are beyond our control, Dengu said in a September 22 interview at the site of the plant and coal mine, that is about 450 kilometres northwest of the capital, Harare. Most of them will say they will finance if Eskom comes on board with an off-take agreement, because they trust Eskom, because it is bankable. ZESA is not bankable, he said.Eskom is aware of some of RioZim s plans, but hasn t had any direct engagement, spokesman Khulu Phasiwe said by phone.Discussions would begin on a government bilateral level and then the utilities would be involved when it reaches a technical stage, he said.Excess capacity could become a part of the Southern African Power Pool, a common market for electricity in the 15-nation Southern African Development Community, he said.Maropeng Ramokgobathi, a spokesman for South Africa s Department of Energy, didn t immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment. &#8211; Bloomberg.
