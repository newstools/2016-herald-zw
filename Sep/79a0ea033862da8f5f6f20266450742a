JOHANNESBURG. Only a catastrophic collapse can prevent Zamalek of Egypt reaching the CAF Champions League soccer final this weekend, but ZESCO United of Zambia hold a precarious lead in the other semi-final. Five-time title-holders Zamalek have a 4-0 lead over one-time winners Wydad Casablanca of Morocco and no club has overcome such a large first-leg deficit in the penultimate phase. Semi-finals debutants ZESCO lead Mamelodi Sundowns of South Africa 2-1 after seeing a good first-leg performance spoilt by conceding a late goal.Both second legs are scheduled for today with Sundowns hosting ZESCO in Pretoria three hours before Wydad and Zamalek clash in Rabat.To stage the greatest comeback since the premier African club competition was launched 52 years ago, 1992 champions Wydad will have to outperform Hafia of Guinea and Hearts of Oak of Ghana.Hafia, then one of the top clubs in Africa, overcame a 3-0 away loss to ASEC Mimosas of the Ivory Coast in 1976 by winning 5-0 at home.One season later, Hearts recovered from a 5-2 drubbing by Mufulira Wanderers of Zambia to win 3-0 at home and squeeze into the final on away goals.Wydad, who eliminated title-holders TP Mazembe of the Democratic Republic of Congo in the qualifying phase, reacted to the unexpectedly heavy loss to Zamalek by firing coach John Toshack one day later.The former Real Madrid manager and Liverpool and Wales striker was replaced by Sebastien Desabre, a Frenchman with considerable African club football experience.
