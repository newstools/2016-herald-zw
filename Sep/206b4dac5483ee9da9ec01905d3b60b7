Dr ChomboThupeyo Muleya Beitbridge Bureau The Department of Immigration has redeployed 157 officers from ports of entry countrywide as part of measures to curb corruption within its rank and file. Though official records say the redeployment was in line with Government s directive to transfer all those who have been at their stations for over five years, insiders said authorities were not happy with rampant cases of corruption that implicated immigration officers.According to a memo dated August 23, and signed by the Department of Immigration s director of administration Mr Stephen Museki and addressed to the principal director of immigration and the director of operations, the transfers were in line with the directive from the Office of the President s circular C/3/667of 19 July, 29016.The Herald is in possession of the document.Sources at Beitbridge yesterday said the transfers had no effective date pending finalisation of a few logistical issues. A total of 157 people have been moved across the board, and 26 of the officers are from Beitbridge Border Post. Most of the officers were already aware of the imminent transfers following a recent visit by Mr Museki to Beitbridge, said the source.So far, the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) has redeployed 500 police officers attested to Beitbridge to various stations across the country, while the Judicial Service Commission has also initiated a similar process.Furthermore, the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (Zimra) and the Vehicle Inspection Department (VID) moved 200 and 46 officers countrywide, respectively.It is reported that the move to redeploy Government workers has been mainly necessitated by the rampant corruption at the ports of entry especially at the Beitbridge border post.Government has since appointed a Cabinet crack team to look into the operations and arresting of smuggling and corruption at Beitbridge border post.The committee is chaired by Home Affairs Minister Dr Ignatius Chombo and other members include the Ministers of Finance and Economic Development, Mines and Mining Development, Environment Water and Climate, Industry and Commerce and Agriculture, Mechanisation and Irrigation Development.During a recent visit to Beitbridge, Dr Chombo said Government had mobilised a total of $600 000, which would be used in marshal resources to curb intrusive leakages that were affecting the maximum collection of revenue at the port of entry.He said the country was losing a lot of potential revenue through underhand dealings at the ports of entries.Dr Chombo said part of the money had been used in setting up CCTVs, purchasing of patrol vehicles, motor bikes, mobile and luggage scanners, metal and lie detectors. It is sad that the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority is collecting $800 000 against a daily average of $1,2 million, he said.
