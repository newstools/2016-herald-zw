Editor Evan Mawarire posted an image on his social media page boasting on how he had badmouthed Zimbabwe to Nigerian magnate, Aliko Dangote. The deranged asylum opportunist and green card fraudster is becoming a mini Tsvangirai, who in the early 2000s went to beg for sanctions from his Western friends. That episode of self-destructive madness is the reason why Zimbabwe is struggling. Now Mawarire wants to go on a similar tirade of trying to scare away prospective investors in a bid to propel his agenda of a struggling country.At a time where the country is trying to court Foreign Direct Investment, it shows whose corner Mawarire is fighting in.He claims that his #ThisFlag is a citizen movement yet he is making it his personal mission to ensure that prospective investors shun the country.The same people he claims to be representing are going to lose out on jobs they were supposed to get, that is if anyone takes a risk of taking him seriously. He also wants to send an opportunistic message, in the event that Dangote decides not to invest in Zimbabwe he will try to get the credit.Zimbabwe was cursed with a terrible brand of activists who are after nothing, but attention and popularity.Another charlatan, Partson Dzamara reportedly went with a petition to the World Bank asking them not to lend Zimbabwe money.This was just a desperate shot at publicity, as Minister Chinamasa s recent visit to England made it clear that the Bretton Woods institutions are not willing to assist the country.It is not surprising, considering that the principals of those institutions are no different to the people who have upheld sanctions on this country for over a decade.Mawarire and Dzamara should carry their theatrics elsewhere other than making wild attempts to tarnish the country s image. They could enjoy their asylum in silence.Cde Chahwanda,Beatrice.
