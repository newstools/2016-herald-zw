The future of Zimbabwe and Turkey lies in the hands of this generation and therefore students awarded these scholarships should take this opportunity to do their best so that when they come back they can apply the knowledge they have acquired to help develop the country. Mr Eris urged students not to forget their home country after they have attained their degrees.Students went through an intensive selection process that was based on qualifications and expertise with main focus centred on key development areas such as agriculture, climate change and governance.
