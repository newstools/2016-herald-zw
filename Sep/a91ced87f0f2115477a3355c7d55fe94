Yaya Toure has announced his retirement from international football.Manchester City midfielder Toure has decided to end a 14-year career playing for Ivory Coast as he battles to regain his place at the Etihad Stadium.Toure, 33, made 102 appearances for Les Elephants scoring 19 goals and last captained the country to their first Africa Cup of Nations victory since 1992.Toure said: After 14 years playing for Les Elephants I have decided to end my adventure playing for the Ivory Coast.&#8220;Some decisions are difficult to take but it is time to pass things on to other players.&#8220;I thank all my supporters and my fans.&#8221;The former Barcelona star is currently trying to force his way back into the first team picture after being snubbed by new manager Pep Guardiola.Toure has been left out of City&#8217;s Champions League squad this season as Guardiola opted to go for players with more industry.But the 300,000-a-week star insists he wants to remain at the Etihad Stadium and prove he is good enough to become a regular starter again.Toure is back in training with the first team squad and is expected to be given a chance to stake his case when City take on Swansea in the EFL Cup on Wednesday.He is regarded as the greatest player ever to come from Africa, and has been named African Footballer of the Year on four occasions.-The Sun
