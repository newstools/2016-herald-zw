Collin Matiza: Sports EditorTHE final event in the 2016 Telecel Drag Racing Series is set for this Sunday at Donnybrook Raceway in Harare, as the season draws to a conclusion ahead of a long break through the rainy season. Thousands of the country s motorsport enthusiasts are, as always, expected to throng the famous motor racing venue in Harare on Sunday to watch this year s final competition of the four-round drag racing series which has now become the premier motorsport event in Zimbabwe. In fact, more than 3 000 spectators went through the gates at Donnybrook at the beginning of August to watch the penultimate round of the 2016 Telecel Drag Racing Series where they were treated to some high octane of racing by both the country s top drivers and bikers; and this Sunday s event will be no exception.This Sunday s Grand Finale event is expected to showcase a continuation of the exciting drag racing action of the earlier May, July and August events which have featured a wide variety of vehicle makes/models and drivers/riders taking on the quarter mile track.Competitors will range from first-timers just out to have some fun, to the rapidly growing number of highly competitive participants determined to move their way up the recently introduced Top Ten Fastest list and improve on previous elapsed times by modifying their vehicles and improving their technique.No matter the level of competitor though, or the amount of horsepower under the bonnet, there is no hiding the ongoing passion for the sport of drag racing. Competition is expected to be particularly fierce on Sunday in the battle for the fastest car and fastest bike of the day.Fans of the AC Cobra will be just as optimistic and confident of victory as fans of the hp lubes/Castrol Toyota MR2 as the friendly grudge between these two competitors reaches its peak.It must not, however, be forgotten that highly competitive Bulawayo driver, Terry Allberry, in his AC Cobra, is expected to attend the Grand Finale after his very noticeable absence from previous events as a result of carrying out works to his impressive Cobra.In the bike classes, the Carlsson brothers, Leslie and Darryl, are expected to retain their positions comfortably ahead of the field on their Suzuki GSXR1000s, although there are several up and coming motorcycle competitors with Angelo Pereira also in the 10-second bracket and Gowero Gilbert, Grant Smith, Tiffany Fisher, Russel Tudhope, De Techtermann, Hussain Lambat and Paul Stevenson keeping the pressure on at the higher end of the 11-second bracket.With racing action getting underway from 11am on Sunday through to late afternoon, the Grand Finale event will include a Sound-Off event hosted by Zimtorque, between 12:30pm and 2pm and the day will conclude with Spinning and Burnouts by Zimbabwe s finest Isaac Mayor Fat Cat , Goofa Team Snap-On and Shannon Spin Kid .On Sunday, the Dragpro Club, who run drag racing in this country, are thinking of offering suicide rides for the spectators.This basically means a member of the public can pay $10 to go down the drag straight with one of the chosen professional drivers and he or she will not be able to choose the driver but the organisers guarantee it to be worth the experience.Gates open on Sunday at 10:30am and admission is $5 per person with children under 12 years getting in for free if accompanied by an adult.There will be full bar and catering as well as jumping castles for the kids.Donnybrook Raceway is adjacent to Harare s high-density suburb of Mabvuku and is accessible either through Acturus Road, after the ZRP Support Unit Camp (near Chikurubi Maximum Prison), or Mutare Road.The 2016 Telecel Drag Racing Series is proudly partnered by Telecel, hp lubes/Castrol, Nemchem, Financial Gazette, Turbo Solutions Africa, Skyscape Aerial Imaging &amp; Survey and Glass Creations.
