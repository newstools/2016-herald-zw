JOHANNESBURG. Zamalek of Egypt suffered a 5-2 thrashing at Wydad Casablanca of Morocco on Saturday, but still qualified to meet Mamelodi Sundowns of South Africa in the CAF Champions League final. The five-time African champions won the first leg of the semi-final 4-0 in Alexandria last weekend and squeezed through 6-5 on aggregate.Attempting to become the first club to wipe out a four-goal deficit in a semi-final of the premier African club competition, Wydad led 5-1 with 26 minutes remaining but trailed on the away-goal rule.One more goal for the Casablanca club would have given them an overall lead, but it was Nigerian Stanley Ohawuchi who had the final say with a late second Zamalek goal.Liberian William Jebor and Congolese Fabrice Ondama scored two goals each and Ismail El Haddad one for Wydad, who led 3-1 at half-time.
