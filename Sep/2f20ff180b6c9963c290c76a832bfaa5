LONDON. Wayne Rooney s Manchester United career is nearing it s end, according to Arsenal legend Ian Wright. Rooney was dropped by manager Jose Mourinho ahead of their 4-1 win over Leicester at Old Trafford on Saturday. And Wright, who scored 128 goals in 221 appearances for the Gunners, believes it is a sign the end is near for the England striker after going through the same thing at Arsenal. It looks like the beginning of the end for Wayne Rooney. He looks tired and most of all, he looks forlorn, Wright told The Sun. All the stick weighs you down and people have been saying he shouldn t be in the team since the start of the season. Juan Mata was the difference on Saturday. The first time a 17-year-old Nicolas Anelka trained with us at Arsenal, I knew I had 18 months left max. There was no way I was stopping that tidal wave. He had everything. I was sat on the bench, watching the future. That s a situation Rooney could find himself in. However, Express Sport understands the 30-year-old has no intention of leaving United for USA s Major League Soccer or anywhere else and will fight for his starting place. The Daily Express-Sky Sports
