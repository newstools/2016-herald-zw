Players who repeatedly breach misconduct rules will face harsher punishments under changes introduced by the International Cricket Council. Yesterday, the ICC introduced demerit points to its code of conduct, which will be added each time a player offends during a two-year period. Punishments, usually fines, will remain for minor offences such as showing dissent and using obscene language. But players guilty of offences can be suspended if they break rules again.All players start on zero points.The ICC confirmed that planned changes to the decision review system making it easier to overturn not-out lbw decisions also came into effect yesterday.For on-field lbw decisions to be reversed by the television umpire, at least half of the ball must be shown to be hitting any part of the stumps.Previously, half of the ball would need to be hitting a zone between the centre of leg and off stumps.
