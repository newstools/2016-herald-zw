Digital technologies including the internet, mobile phones, and all the other tools we use to share information digitally have spread quickly. The number of internet users globally has tripled in the past decade, from one billion in 2005 to an estimated 3,2 billion by the end of 2015. Since the introduction of the Internet to Africa in 1991, it s reached just over 20 percent penetration continent-wide. In Zimbabwe alone, the penetration rate is over 47 percent.Changing the way we liveThe internet is revolutionising the way we solve problems at an individual, community, business, and societal level. Much of the benefit from the internet is unmeasured, as it can t be captured in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) statistics, such as time saved, convenience, expanded choice, better quality leisure time, and access to more knowledge.People s perceptions, however, are that internet connectivity and digital technologies have made them better off. Various studies conducted in Africa show that 65 percent of Africans believe that their family is better off, while 20 percent disagree (14,5 percent not sure).Internet-based distance education could improve quality of life in the most remote rural areas of Africa, counterbalancing the general lack of local libraries or learning facilities.One of the biggest challenges African internet service providers (ISPs) like ZOL are combating, is the reality of being left behind in terms of global technological development.This digital divide results in inequality between countries that have embraced digital technologies and countries that are just emerging.Even in countries where individuals have the ability and are capable of accessing the internet, most are still limited by their country s infrastructure.However, thanks to fibre optic cables and WiMax broadband many African countries, including Zimbabwe are starting to see rapid growth in digital connectivity.There s growing evidence of the Internet s importance to job creation, productivity, economic growth, and social inclusion.Individuals and businesses connect to broadband networks such as ZOL Zimbabwe s Fibroniks to reach experts, and other professionals; to access education; to find employers, employees, and suppliers; and to enjoy entertainment.Broadband can also extend the availability of quality education, healthcare and government services much more cost-effectively than through the extensive expansion of physical infrastructure.Facebook commissioned a study to examine how extending internet access can change economies and societies in developing countries and what this would mean in terms of economic and social growth.The findings suggest that if developing countries can bridge the gap in internet penetration to reach levels developed economies enjoy today, they d experience large increases in GDP growth and productivity and improvements in health conditions and education opportunities.The study estimates that the resulting economic activity could generate $2,2 trillion in additional GDP, a 72 percent increase in the GDP growth rate, and more than 140 million new jobs.Without access to broadband, many Africans will be blocked from access to and participation in many of the opportunities that those in other countries take for granted.Changing the way we workBefore companies started using the Internet for commercial use in the mid-1990s, suppliers could only reach them by phone, fax, and mail or in person.Since then, the Internet has provided many benefits to the businesses who use it. The Internet has been credited with making the world smaller .It allows anyone with a computer, tablet or smart phone to think globally and has allowed the business world to build international relationships with new vendors as well as new customers.It affords most businesses the ability to operate internationally, but it also reduces costs whilst increasing productivity.Business managers can hold conference calls and video-conferences (meetings) with colleagues and customers in different cities or countries.Human resources managers save on paper costs by posting jobs online and having candidates submit applications via the Internet.Organisations can upload manuals and video content on the Internet so distant employees can train without having to attend corporate training centres.It also supports growth of local clusters such as tourism, agriculture, and manufacturing.One of the most widely-cited benefits of the Internet, however, is the positive impact on the customer experience.In most industries, but especially retail, it s changing the way customers interact with brands and how sales are made; 38 percent of customers prefer to visit an organisation s website to find out about their products and services, instead of visiting them in person.Small businesses might only need an email address to communicate with their clients, customers and suppliers. Other businesses might use their website to conduct their entire business online.The many benefits of online business include:Global access 24 /7 /365Improved customer serviceCost savingsFaster delivery of productsOpportunities to manage your business from anywhere in the world.ZOL s high speed Fibroniks and WiMax broadband services have already started making a massive difference to businesses and families in Zimbabwe.With many people connecting with family in the diaspora, sending and receiving money; businesses seeking the best talent and expanding their digital footprint internationally, it s never been more crucial to be connected.&nbsp;Contact the ZOL experts on 08677 111 111 toll-free from an Econet line, or download the myzol app for Android or iOS to find out how we can connect you with the world, because you deserve to live like this.
