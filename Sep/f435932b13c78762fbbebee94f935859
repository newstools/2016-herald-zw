Sikhumbuzo Moyo in Bulawayo Highlanders &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..0) 2Ngezi Platinum &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..(0) 1 A 90th minute controversial penalty given to Highlanders by referee Pilan Ncube saw Bosso keeping their title hopes alive as they defeated a plucky Ngezi Platinum in a rather dull Castle Lager Premiership soccer encounter at Barbourfields yesterday.The hotly-contested spot-kick was awarded to Bosso after Talent Chamboko pulled substitute Ralph Matema s shorts as he was trying to go for what could have been a diving header.Skipper Erick Mudzingwa buried the resultant spot-kick with a rising shot that sent Chris Mverechera the wrong way.It was, however, not before there was a five-minute stoppage as Ngezi Platinum players protested against the referee s decision to award the home side a penalty.But the referee s decision was, however, spot on. Even television replays clearly showed Chamboko pulling Matema s short. I am hugely disappointed by the decision of the referee, we surely did not deserve to lose in this way. That was not a penalty at all, there was no contact, Highlanders are a great side, they are in the championship race and no one must assist them to win games. They can do it without any assistance, said a visibly angry Ngezi Platinum coach Tonderayi Ndiraya.The visitors had surged ahead in the 66th minute after Bosso had failed to clear a Tatenda Mchisa s corner.Ngezi Platinum almost went ahead as early as the fourth minute but alert defender Tendai Ndlovu cleared off the line James Nguluve s shot.The speedy Nguluve, who was always a menace in the match until he was substituted, headed the ball over an advancing Ariel Sibanda and quickly shot at goal before tearing away to celebrate but Bosso fans heaved a sigh of relief when Ndlovu cleared off the line.Fans were treated to some boring football with no goal mouth-action.In the 26th minute, Tendai Ngulube miscued a Prince Dube pass with the goalkeeper Mverechera at his mercy.In the 32nd minute Allan Gahadzikwa headed wide from the outstanding Rahman Kutsanzira cross.Bosso were finding it hard to penetrate the water tight visitors defence which was well marshalled by Partson Jaure.As early as the second minute of the second half, Ariel Sibanda made a brilliant save when he went airborne to tip a dangerous lob-in by Chamboko.Highlanders made their first substitution in the 65th minute, pulling out youngster Nhlanhla Ndlovu for Matema. Two minutes later Kutsanzira forced an excellent save from Mverechera who acrobatically went for his cross with fans expecting a goal which, however, came seven minutes later and what a goal it was.Simon Munawa started the move from the middle of the park when he released another substitute Gabriel Nyoni on the far right. The speedy Nyoni beat one man and got into the box but under challenge from Chamboko who was did not commit himself as he feared a penalty.Meanwhile, Munawa was making an off the ball run and when he got into the penalty box arc, he was quickly spotted by Nyoni who laid the ball for him and from there Munawa let loose a booming and rising shot that was written goal all over it from the moment the ball left his right foot.Mverechera never saw it coming and Bosso were back on level terms.Nyoni had come in for Honest Moyo when Bosso made a tactical substitution to use a 3-4-3 formation in a bid to open up the compact Ngezi Platinum defence. We read their move and quickly adjusted our system too by having two holding midfielders, said Ndiraya.The visitors seemed content with a point gained as they deployed more men at the back. Right at the death, Highlanders made one last surge towards goal with Matema that resulted in a beaten Chamboko pulling his shorts and referee Ncube rightfully pointed to the spot.Upstepped Mudzingwa to send Mverechera the wrong way while Barbourfields Stadium erupted in dance. We conceded a stupid goal from a corner which we should have avoided. I am happy with the win regardless how we got it, said a happy Erol Akbay, the Highlanders coach.The match might be the last of the season for Bosso goalkeeper Ariel Sibanda after he was pulled out in the 80th minute with a swollen eye. I was hit by the ball as I went for a save and the doctors said my eye is full of blood. I will know my fate tomorrow, said Sibanda. He was replaced by Njabulo Nyoni.TeamsHighlanders: Ariel Sibanda,(Njabulo Nyoni80th min) Rahman Kutsanzira, Simon Munawa, Prince Dube, Tendai Ndlovu, Peter Muduhwa, Tendai Ngulube, Honest Moyo (Gabriel Nyoni 70th min) Erick Mudzingwa, Nhlanhla Ndlovu, ( Ralph Matema 65th minute), Allen GahadzikwaNgezi Platinum: Criss Mverechera, Byron Madzomere, Partson Jaure, James Marufu, Liberty Chakoroma, Talent Chamboko, Tatenda Mchisa, Donald Teguru, James Nguluve(Washington Pakamisa 81st minute) , Terence Dzvukamanja, Edgar Tapera.
