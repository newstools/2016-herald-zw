SYDNEY. Australia captain Stephen Moore is expecting a hostile atmosphere at Loftus Versfeld for their Rugby Championship clash with South Africa on Saturday. Moore knows a Springbok team with their backs against the wall is a dangerous team and said playing at Loftus would aid the home side. After a tough start to the season Australia are looking to build on their 36-20 win over Argentina a fortnight ago while South Africa are under pressure following their inept performance in going down 41-13 to New Zealand. They would have come under some heat in the last few weeks with their recent results and they re going to want to play well, Moore told the Canberra Times. They re one of those teams that you know are always going to play well at home. They ve got very passionate home support there and particularly at Loftus. It s a strong rugby tradition there and very hostile environment there. To play, whether it s Super Rugby against the Bulls or in a Test match, we d expect them to play very well. I know we ve had a couple of wins but that certainly doesn t change anything from our perspective we want to go over and give a good account of ourselves. AFP.
