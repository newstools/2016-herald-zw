Munyaradzi KerekeFidelis Munyoro : Chief Court ReporterBikita West legislator Munyaradzi Kereke, who is serving an effective 10 years in jail for raping his then 11-year-old niece, on Wednesday launched an application for bail pending appeal at the High Court. The bail hearing will be heard tomorrow. Kereke s lawyers, Mutandiro, Chitsanga and Associates, have hired Advocate Thabani Mpofu to argue the matter. In an application filed in the High Court, Kereke wants the court to allow him to deposit with the clerk of court, Harare magistrate s court, a sum of $2000.He also proposed to surrender title deeds of a single immovable property and passport to the clerk of court.In addition, he would be amenable to continue residing at number 12 St Andrews, Hatfield in Harare, until the finalisation of the appeal and other stringent conditions. Applicant has very strong prospects which cannot induce abscondment, said Adv Mpofu. The fact that he has been convicted is, accordingly, inconsequential. Applicant is firmly established in Zimbabwe and can make no living outside the country. His huge family and economic interests are all in the country. He would lose everything were he to abscond.
