UFIC ChoirNaledi Sande : Arts ReporterAll is set for One Voice inter-denominational praise and worship Concert that is set for Harare International Conference Centre tomorrow. Spirit Praise group director Learnmore Tavengwa said they managed to bring together 17 groups for the concert from different churches. He said, We ended up cutting down the number because it is a one day concert but next year we are hoping to have a festival of the two to three days of praise. The groups that are going to be performing include UFIC choir, Covenant Choir, Heartfelt Worship Team, Africa Praise and Redeemed Praise Team.ZAOGA UCCI Choir, Zaoga Breaside choir, Faith World Worship team, Avondale Anglican Youth and Victory Praise team will also be amongst the choirs that are going to be on stage at the concert.Tavengwa said the event is not a fundraising concert, but it is an initiative to raise the worship banner in all nations. We want people to learn from each other how best we can worship God, exchanging notes regardless of denominations. Let us come and worship God with One Voice, said Tavengwa. We are selling tickets because we do not have sponsorships yet so we are trying to cover bills and everything since almost everything is coming from Spirit Praise team s pocket. But we are hoping to get sponsorship next year to cover such things as venue, police clearance and stuff so that people can attend the concert for free. Tavengwa also asserted that the concert is going to be an annual event held at the same time of the year but will go to different towns.Spirit Praise team is currently riding high on songs like Makanaka and Anodaira from their recently released album Yatokwana Nguva .
