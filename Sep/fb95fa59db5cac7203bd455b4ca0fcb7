Tapiwa Dingwiza flanked by models wearing some of her creations during the Zimbabwe Fashion Showcase UK recentlyTafadzwa Moyo: Fashion Talk 263Oh, once again the weekend is here!How many agree with me that two days seem too short for a weekend break?Be fashionable, be merry. Life is short, but ladies your heels should not be.Gents make sure fashion should be a form of escapism and not a form of imprisonment.Anyway September is halfway and this means the peak of wedding season has finally started.So wearing white doesn t have to cost you a lot of green.That is, if you schedule your wedding ceremony, reception and honeymoon during the off-season.During off-peak months, wedding vendors hunger for business. The most popular marrying months are May through October, said wedding designer Joyce Scardina Becker.Becker who is the president of Events of Distinction and author of Countdown to Your Perfect Wedding , said wedding colours should be fashionable.I laughed last week when I heard people complaining about the weird colour names for wedding that are being suggested.One thing you need to know is that the wedding theme colours are for the bridal team ONLY not for those invited otherwise you might end up distorting the theme.This week we focus on the jumpsuit.As versatile and stylish as the little black dress, the jumpsuit is gaining serious attention as this summer s go-to fashion look.Just look at Kristen Stewart s sequined Chanel jumpsuit and Jennifer Lawrence s sleek black Dior equivalent on the red carpet at the recent Cannes.According to stylist Terri Dacquisto with Plutino Group, one should not fear trying the look because you should choose flattering fabrics and cuts to make it trendy. You want a fabric that skims the body and doesn t cling to all the wrong places.As for undergarments, opt for seamless bottoms and nude or dark tones, depending on the style.Be aware of the cut and make sure that the silhouette accentuates your curves, she said.So with jumpsuit you can wear it anywhere.Layer your jumpsuit with a silk cami and a fitted blazer for the office, then transition to night by removing the cami and throwing your blazer over your shoulders with a great strappy heel.You can even kick it up a notch with a statement necklace and your favourite clutch.Again try finding your best fit.Ensure that the jumpsuit fits the length of your torso as well as the width don t be afraid to go up a size if you need the length.Look for a jumpsuit with a clinched waist that falls on or just above your waistline to create that covetable hourglass silhouette.One golden rule is when it comes to the short jumpsuit, make sure you choose heels for a sexier, mature look and avoid wearing flats or sneakers.Avoid bright colours and loud prints.Instead opt for solid colours and more elegant fabrics such as silk and end your look on the right foot, depending on the occasion and style, either a pump, wedge or stiletto looks fantastic.Star of the weekTapiwa DingwizaCurrently based in the United Kingdom, Tapiwa Dingwiza was born in Zimbabwe to the late Pastor Dingwiza and Mama Dingwiza, who ministered in Church of Christ in Masvingo.Her parents were hard working, honest and compassionate people and it is from them that Tapiwa got her work ethic. They earned their living from sewing dresses, bags and jerseys and would exchange them for maize.It was through this way that school fees for her and her sibling s education was paid. Their parents would also feed some of the rural members of the church from the proceeds that came from sale of these sewn merchandise. During this rough period, Tapiwa had no idea that it was preparation time for her destiny.She had no idea that the skills she was acquiring at home were stirring up in her the gifts of God within her and would later lead her to a happy life.She founded S Vingo. Bespoke is derived from my hometown, Masvingo, as it where everything initially started. Bespoke tailoring is a handcraft that gave me the opportunity to construct a garment from scratch using the treasured British methods of tailoring which I can confidently apply on any of my garments. I have acquired the skills for mass production tailoring and decided to do Bespoke tailoring in order to be able to personalise or individually construct a garment according to the specifications of the client. I love making garments that enhance confidence paying attention to details, silhouette, and fabrics and at the same time setting my own trend at my own pace, she said.She said she was inspired by her childhood education. My collection is menswear and women s wear that has been inspired by my childhood education. I attended a boarding school in Zimbabwe, Zimuto High School, that we shared with blind students at Copota School for the Blind and they used braille as a means of communication and after a thorough research, experiments and visits to blind or visually impaired centres around London, I decided to incorporate braille in my garments. Every garment that I made has leather embossed or embroidered message in braille. The collection seeks to create a relationship between a wearer and a garment by simply having a secret message, a memorable event or inspirational words written on your garment in braille. Social inclusion is key in this collection hence it is for any modern, confident, classic and playful man, sighted or blind, she cited.Tapiwa said she would love to continue within the trade of Bespoke in an established tailoring house and at the same time taking pride in transferring skills to the younger generation.The designer said the Zimbabwe fashion industry is the best because designers are adapting to change. I think the industry is trying its best and a lot of Zimbabwean designers at home and in the diaspora are doing quite well and working hard. What could be of help to the Zimbabwean industry would be educational centres that are mainly created to enable those who are keen to develop their skills at a professional level. I would be very proud to be selling my clothes in Zimbabwe as it will be an honour to see them in the country where I initially nurtured my skills. It was an honour to be part of the Zimbabwe Fashion Showcase UK, led by Chiedza Dawn Ziyambe, the fact that it was initiated by a fellow Zimbabwean, she explained.
