Europe s Lee Westwood says Tiger Woods role as a USA vice-captain for the Ryder Cup could have an adverse effect in the team room . Woods, a 14-time major winner, will be one of Davis Love III s four vice-captains in Minnesota on 30 September. Former world number one Woods, (40) has won only one of the six Ryder Cups he has competed in. People have always seemed to try to do too much when they have partnered him, Westwood (43), told ESPN. It might be different if he s one of the vice-captains you don t know. Europe, the defending champions, have won six of the past seven Ryder Cups. Westwood, who has seven Ryder Cup victories from nine appearances, is one of captain Darren Clarke s three wildcard picks in a 12-man Europe team featuring six rookies.Westwood said of the USA: They have got a strong side and probably are favourites, but they haven t won it for a while and they are playing in front of a home crowd. There is a lot of pressure on them. That is going to keep building in the next week or so and by the time the Ryder Cup comes around it is going to be pretty intense for them. BBC.
