Daniel Nemukuyu Senior Court Reporter BARELY six months after its launch, Zimbabwe People First (ZimPF) led by Dr Joice Mujuru is failing to pay $15 000 to a company that printed T-shirts for the political outfit. Adlyn Printers (Pvt) Limited printed 5 000 T-Shirts worth $15 000 for the opposition party in June this year but no payment was made, in violation of the agreement.The company, through its lawyers TK Hove and Partners, recently issued summons at the High Court claiming $15 000 plus interest.Interest, according to the summons, should be calculated at the prescribed rate of 5 percent per annum from September 13, 2016 to the date of payment of the debt in full.In the plaintiff s declaration, it is stated that on June 23 this year, the political party and the printing firm entered an agreement in which Adlyn Printers would print and deliver 5 000 T-shirts to the newly formed ZimPF.The T-shirts were printed but the political party did not pay the agreed price of $15 000 despite demand.On August 17 2016, ZimPF s vice chairperson for Harare Province, Mr Emmanuel Chiroto, and the company s representatives met over the debt.Mr Chiroto, on behalf of the party, signed a deed of settlement in which ZimPF undertook to clear the debt in two monthly instalments of $7 500.The party undertook to make the payments into the bank account of Adlyn Printers director Mr Simbarashe Gukutu.The first instalment, according to the deed of settlement, was to be paid by August 31, while the second instalment was agreed to have been paid by September 30.However, come end of August the political party reneged on its obligation, resulting in the company instituting legal proceedings.Such disregard of the provisions of the deed of settlement, the company said, attracted an order for costs on a punitive scale against the political party.ZimPF is yet to file its response to the summons.
