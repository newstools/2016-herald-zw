A handful of ThisFlag followers stand outside Zimbabwe s Mission to the UN in New York after an abortive demonstration.Obi Egbuna Jnr : Correspondent FROM the moment Mbuya Nehanda and Sekuru Kaguvi organised everyday Zimbabweans to courageously take up arms against Rhodesian settlers and invaders way back in 1896, the colonialist and imperialist world have learnt the hard way, that the element of surprise has always been the best weapon of genuine African resistance at home and abroad. When Zanu began the Second Chimurenga against the second most powerful colonial army ever assembled on our beloved mother continent 50 years ago, which cleared the way for President Mugabe and Zanu-PF to launch the historic and ground-breaking land reclamation programme 16 years ago that boldly declared the beginning of the Third Chimurenga, one would think US-EU imperialism finally realised that imposing their will on Zimbabweans politically, economically or militarily is no walk in the park.Hundreds of December 12 Movement members turned up for a solidarity march through the streets of New York.Since Pastor Evan Mawarire used social media and hijacked a revolutionary idea to use Zimbabwe s flag to rally Africans worldwide to join the movement to end the Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act of 2001, each and every one of President Mugabe and Zanu-PF s most hateful detractors in Washington and London have not only been tickled pink, but are guilty of openly behaving like their illegal and racist regime change agenda aimed at toppling Zimbabwe s democratically elected Government had officially prevailed.What Pastor Mawarire and #ThisFlag members learnt on Saturday September 17 2016 at the Zimbabwe Mission to the United Nations in New York City, was to never under any circumstances disregard the power of true and authentic revolutionary solidarity, something that biblical verses from a colonialist and imperialist paradigm simply cannot prepare an opportunist leader or movement to properly deal with.Because Pastor Mawarire and his gullible followers had made a routine of taking photo-ops in front of the Zimbabwean embassy in Washington DC, which led to someone mysteriously desecrating the embassy with graffiti, the pastor and his brain trust arrived at the conclusion that targeting the mission before converging on the UN would help generate momentum.To the surprise of Pastor Mawarire who had boldly predicted that over 5 000 Zimbabweans would be by his side, only 19 misled but undeniably faithful followers arrived to participate in a pre-protest in front of the mission, that was advertised as lasting from 10am to 12 noon. Due to the extremely low and embarrassing turnout this only lasted about 29 minutes to be exact.Another shock to the system of Pastor Mawarire and his followers is they were not allowed to plaster the mission with their neo-colonialist regalia, this was brought to their attention by none other than the racist and fascist NYPD, who according to history and pedigree were not thrilled but had no choice but to enforce this law. This reduced #ThisFlag members efforts to talking to primarily individuals of a Caucasian persuasion who were on their Saturday morning strolls therefore had no interest in what they represented.Since Pastor Mawarire s main platforms thus far have been primarily confined to the dog and pony shows courtesy of the US-EU imperialist think tank apparatus and any bonus events arranged by the US State Department, the good pastor s handlers probably never shared with him that it is virtually impossible to come to New York City and attack President Mugabe and Zanu-PF, without being confronted directly by the December 12 Move- ment.It is only fitting that Pastor Mawarire had the opportunity to see D12 up close and personal in the middle of a protest, especially since it is abundantly clear that the misguided pastor more than likely has been advised by his handlers to avoid at all costs so-called African Americans, who accurately fit the characteristic of what President Mugabe commonly refers to when speaking publicly as Comrades and Friends.Even if Pastor Mawarire and his followers had previously been warned by the Who s Who of the US Military Industrial Intelligence Police Complex, that D12 was planning a counter and unapologetically pro-President Mugabe and Zanu-PF demonstration, the parachutes on their shoulders and over the top exposure from US imperialist media outlets like CNN and NPR had them feeling untouchable.This was confirmed by the presence of a Voice of America reporter who witnessed the entire spectacle. However, due to the outcome will have a serious challenge, explaining to the Zimbabweans in the Diaspora who according to Pastor Mawarire and his followers ended up resembling a meteorologist who gave viewers and listeners the wrong weather forecast.Only 19 faithful followers participated in Pastor Mawarire s (pictured right) flopped protest in front of Zimbnabwe s UN Mission in New York, that was advertised as lasting from 10am to 12 noon. Due to the extremely low and embarrassing turnout this only lasted about 29 minutes, to be exactLet us remember that according to Pastor Mawarire s Facebook page, Zimbabwean students in the Diaspora are 58 percent in favour of the US imperialist agenda, the burning question is why these toy soldiers who demonise their President and Government all over social media decided not to come to the Big Apple and stand with their pastor who boldly proclaims We are the leaders we have been waiting for .The explanation given by Mawarire and his followers whose mood and body language resembled women and men, when they get stood up on a date, was that the main demonstration near the UN Headquarters would reflect the numbers they had anticipated and boldly predicted.What occurred instead was that the D12 march from the Zimbabwe UN Mission completely stole the show, President Mugabe s Comrades and Friends started from 53rd and Lexington Avenue with banners of all sizes brandishing their patterned and trademark slogan MUGABE IS RIGHT .Unlike the 19 followers of Pastor Mawarire who looked as though they were loitering in front of the mission, this strong showing of unity and patriotism aroused the interest of spectators and onlookers, who were apparently wondering what African head of state could garner this qualitative level of support inside US borders.This development meant that the Voice of America reporter had to resort to damage control and interview Pastor Mawarire from angles aimed at diverting attention from such a low turnout, by the end of the day #This Flag drew 50 people to their UN demonstration where on the other hand D12 drew over 100 who to their credit assembled with an agenda and purpose of their own, meaning showing support for President Mugabe and Zanu-PF took precedence over clashing with political novices like Pastor Mawarire and #This Flag.Another lesson Pastor Mawarire and his followers can take from Saturday is that they do not have a monopoly on social media, a few weeks ago D12 brilliantly juxtaposed a picture of the good pastor with US and British flags wrapped around his neck, which raised the issue that #This Flag should use the symbols of the nations whose interests they faithfully serve and represent on a daily basis. President Mugabe s Comrades and Friends followed this up with a US passport with the good pastor s name and face.What was billed and promoted as an event that would be the defining moment for the #This Flag movement, with thousands of Zimbabweans calling for President Mugabe to step down, numerically matched Pastor Mawarire s Sunday congregation of his storefront church back home in Zimbabwe.Only 19 faithful followers participated in Pastor Mawarire s (pictured right) flopped protest in front of Zimbnabwe s UN Mission in New York, that was advertised as lasting from 10am to 12 noon. Due to the extremely low and embarrassing turnout this only lasted about 29 minutes, to be exactWhen Pastor Mawarire and his followers step out of their comfort zone which means engaging so-called African Americans in an atmosphere, where the helping hand of Douglas Coltart and Chloe McGrath cannot serve as a security blanket, they don t appear to be politically or intellectually equipped to answer some very fundamental questions.During the march when D12 members who decided to show at the mission to strategically observe #ThisFlag, told the VOA reporter was how embarrassing it looked for young Zimbabweans who have benefited more than they realise from countless drops of blood shed heroically from 1896 to present, to come to the country who has illegally targeted their Government and stage a protest.What Pastor Mawarire and his followers will eventually realise is that the history they reject like children who cry when told by their parents to eat their vegetables, is what makes not only D12 but Africans all over the world stand firmly behind President Mugabe and Zanu-PF.Obi Egbuna Jnr is the US Correspondent to the Herald and External Relations Officer of Zicufa (Zimbabwe Cuba Friendship Association) his email is [email&#160;protected]
