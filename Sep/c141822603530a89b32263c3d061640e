(0) HARDLIFE Mavundi s second half strike sent Triangle through to Chibuku Super Cup quarter-finals after they edged Chicken Inn at Gibbo yesterday.The game was played under rare chilly conditions in the lowveld but the home side adjusted well and almost took the lead in the 12th minute when Mavundi set up Marvellous Mukumba whose effort flew just inches over the bar.Chicken Inn coach Rahman Gumbo made a first half tactical substitution, introducing Nicholas Muchadeyi for Physwell Madhazi, in the 33rd minute but Triangle continued to dominate the midfield.The visitors got the best chance on the hour mark but veteran striker Obadiah Tarumbwa drove his effort wide after a clever pass from Clemence Ma- tawu. How can you dominate the game like this for ninety minutes and fail to win, It s the same story of being in control of the game and end up losing? said Gumbo. We have another game (league) on Thursday and I think it s high time we give fresh players a chance to play. Triangle coach David Mandigora was a happy man after finally winning a game. I am happy for the boys who worked hard for it, it s also a relief because we lost four games in a row and it s good for the team, he said.
