The meeting was a follow-up to the first one held in May this year in which ZEC tabled its plans to run the 2018 election under a biometric voter s roll in order to curb cases of double voting. On Thursday, stakeholders gathered to discuss other outstanding issues related to elections, but Mr Mliswa stirred chaos, resulting in the meeting being prematurely ended.The Commission s chairperson, Justice Rita Makarau confirmed the development saying the commission had to call off the meeting. Mr Mliswa came in and raised issues to do with Norton by-elections. He behaved in a disorderly manner and other political parties joined in, creating a chaotic situation. He became uncontrollable and the one chairing the meeting could not control him. We had to abort the meeting and nothing was discussed today, said Justice Makarau.Mr Mliswa also confirmed the development, but accused ZEC of failing to address his concerns. I simply told the gathering that ZEC is a toothless bulldog that fails to address my concerns. We have written to them, but they did not act, said Mr Mliswa.Mr Mliswa said he was having problems with the police who were in the habit of barring him from holding meetings.He said each time he intends to hold a meeting, he has to approach the High Court.At the first meeting, Justice Makarau told journalists that ZEC required about $55 million to implement the biometric voting system. Justice Makarau said she had already communicated with Government and the response had been favourable.Mr Mliswa is one of the three candidates who will contest the Norton seat.&nbsp;
