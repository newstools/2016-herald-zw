LONDON. Mauricio Pochettino has confirmed Harry Kane suffered ankle ligament damage in Sunday s 1-0 win over Sunderland but has refused to speculate on how long the striker will be out. Kane suffered the injury midway through the second half of Sunday s victory which lifted Spurs to third in the Premier League after an unbeaten start to the season and will end his run of 71 consecutive starts in the league. Speaking ahead of today s EFL Cup clash with Gillingham, Pochettino said: He (Kane) has injured his ankle ligaments. We will continue to assess him every day but don t want to put a time-frame on it. Today it s impossible to give a time for a recovery. I am not a doctor. I can only explain what the doctors said to me. Sky Sports.&nbsp;
