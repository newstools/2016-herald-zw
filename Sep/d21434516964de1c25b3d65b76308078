Thandeka Moyo Bulawayo Bureau SIGNIFICANT rains are expected to start from next Monday as winter is now over, the Meteorological Services Department (MSD) said on Monday.In a statement, the MSD said last Saturday, moisture entered the country from Botswana and South Africa resulting in cloudy and relatively cool weather in Matabeleland as well as the southern half of the Midlands and Masvingo provinces resulting in thunderstorms and drizzle in areas such as in Victoria Falls and Kezi the following day. This incursion of moisture is a significant and positive omen for what to expect as per the 2016-17 seasonal rainfall forecast, said the MSD.It said from tomorrow until Sunday, the whole country should return to the hot to very hot and dry weather. This should be in preparation for the second incursion of more moist air into country that should bring more, but significant rains from September 26, reads the statement.The MSD advised members of the public against directly exposing themselves to the sun. Winter is now over. Until the end of October, the weather over the country should be mostly hot to very hot. Nights should be uncomfortable also, with an increase in mosquitoes. As such, the public is strongly discouraged from direct exposure to sunlight as this causes heat stress and discomfort on people and livestock, said the MSD. Outdoor activities such as sport should be avoided between 12:00 (noon) and 3PM. Chances for runway fires remain very high so the public is urged to refrain from unnecessary burning of pastures. The MSD recently said inputs, including small grains, should be distributed to all regions by the end of September in Matabeleland South, Masvingo, Midlands and southern districts of Manicaland and by the end of October for the rest of the country in anticipation of the rains.The news comes as a relief to farmers, most of whom suffered losses in the last agricultural season due to the drought.
