MONZA. Defending world Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton heads to this weekend s Italian Grand Prix knowing that a hat-trick of successive wins at Monza will put him in charge of the title race after one of the most roller-coaster seasons of his career. The Briton has a nine-point lead ahead of Mercedes teammate Nico Rosberg ahead of the final race of the European season, leaving seven overseas contests remaining. The result in Spa, at the Belgian Grand Prix, was as good as damage limitation can be, for me &#8212; a fantastic result for me and for the team, said Hamilton. Now we go to Monza, a track I know well from so many racing categories in my career and one that is impossible not to love. I had a perfect weekend last year and I know if I can repeat that it will be amazing. With all my penalties out of the way now, and fresh engines ready to use, it s game on for me! Hamilton, who was 43 points behind after five races, knows he will face a tough challenge from not only Rosberg, but also Ferrari on their home turf as they seek to end a run of disappointing results in front of the tifosi . I m enjoying this battle and we ve got several cars in the mix, said Rosberg. For me, it is one at a time and every race is like a cup final. It s great to know I have the team and the car to go out and lay it on the line. AFP.
