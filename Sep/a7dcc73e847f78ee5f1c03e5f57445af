Help desks constituting legal experts from the Zimbabwe Women Lawyers Association, Women Lawyers in Southern Africa, Legal Resources Foundation, Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights, Justice for Children Trust and the Royal Danish Embassy will have an office at every courthouse to assist the indigent in accessing justice.The 22 court houses constructed by JSC have a room reserved for legal officers who assist the less privileged before they appear in court.At Chitungwiza Magistrates Court, help desks are already operational and the signing of the MoU will see the desks established at all magistrates courts.This relief for the self-actors is set to assist the indigent with strong legal cases who require coaching on how to articulate their facts before the courts of law.Courts will also find it easier dealing with enlightened litigants who know the procedure and what to say in court.The new development complements the already existing Legal Aid Directorate which has since decentralised to all provinces.Parties signed the MoU at the official opening of a newly constructed Murambinda Magistrates Court in Buhera yesterday.Officially opening the new magistrate s court yesterday, Justice Rita Makarau hailed the civic society organisations for the noble decision of promoting access to quality justice for all people in the country. I say congratulations to the civic society members who signed the MoU on legal hep desks today.You have done the right thing. Most people lose cases because they do not know the procedure followed in court and what to say when they appear before magistrates, who are naturally intimidating.Justice Makarau said help desks become critical in such situations.Ms Debora Barron from the Legal Resources Foundation said the help desks will also benefit the court.Ms Barron said the new development was unique because a group of legal aid providers will be working together.The opening of the court was witnessed by Minister of State for Manicaland Province Mandi Chimene, Cde Joseph Chinotimba, Cde Oliver Mandipaka, Cde Ronald Muderedzwa and traditional leaders.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
