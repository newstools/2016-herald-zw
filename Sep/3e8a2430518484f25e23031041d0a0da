From Victoria Ruzvidzo in Seoul, South KoreaMore than 200 000 people attended a peace festival here yesterday at the Seoul Olympic Stadium to commemorate the September 18 World Alliance of Religions Peace.Government leaders, the judiciary, media and civil society representatives from across the globe joined thousands of South Koreans to commemorate the initiative launched by the Heavenly Culture, World Peace, Restoration of Light (HWPL) in 2014 to foster peace.Two historic pledges made at the summit last year, the World Alliance of Religions Agreement and the Enactment of International Law for the Cessation of Wars.The summit broke down the walls between different nationalities, cultures and religions. Efforts made over the past year culminated in the proclamation of the Declaration of Peace and Cessation of War (DPCW) while religious leaders were also establishing common ground to promote peace.The giant Seoul Olympic stadium, with a sitting capacity of 160 000 built for the 1988 Olympic games hosted by South Korea, was overflowing as it reverberated into song, dance and traditional Korean cultural performances with a theme centred on the benefits of peace in a world presently infested with wars and conflicts that have claimed millions of lives.During the six-hour event, Zimbabwe s flag flew high with those of some African countries and others of the countries actively participating in bringing about harmony.Chief Justice Godfrey Chidyausiku is leading the Zimbabwean delegation which includes legal experts, youth and women leaders.Speeches by the HWPL founder and chairman Man Hee Lee, the International Women s Peace Group chairwoman Nam Hee Kim, government representatives and other presentations emphasised the need to redouble efforts so that world peace would become a reality soon.Mr Lee implored countries to sign the DPCW and take peace efforts to the next level. If heads of state truly love their countries, people and peace,they will sign their support for the declaration. If one refuses to sign, his people and descendants will criticise such inaction, and it will be recorded in his country s history forever, he said.Former Croatian president Ivo Josipovic said his country had endured years of turmoil and peace was the only option. We must ask ourselves which side of the human nature is going to win; darkness or light. The worst scenario is the triumph of darkness and the disappearance of human beings through a nuclear catastrophe, he said.International Youth Peace Group director Duhyen Kim said youths were keen on peace and would carry the message forward. I have seen how a young generation -a generation that many have written off as entitled, spoiled, or disengaged with reality, a generation often disparagingly referred to as the millennials has begun to open its mouth and raise its voice in a call for peace that both local governments and intergovernmental organisations will not be able to ignore for long, he said.A major plea was made for the unification of North and South Korea if the Koreans themselves were to experience sustainable peace.The WARP Summit ends today.
