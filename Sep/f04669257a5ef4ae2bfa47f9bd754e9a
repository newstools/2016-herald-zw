The story of a 14-year-old HIV positive boy from Makonde District, who sexually abused seven young girls between the ages of four and seven, is spine chilling and it calls for parents and guardians to be on the lookout for all possible forms of abuse children are likely to face. The issue of disclosure of HIV status still remains a confidential matter, but we implore all stakeholders in HIV and AIDS intervention mechanisms and strategies to spring to action and assist these hapless minors highly exposed to the scourge.Keeping this issue of the girls who were abused by the 14-year-old boy whether intentionally or unintentionally under wraps, exposes the children to the virus and is as good as committing genocide.In the story we carried on our page one yesterday, there is also an element of undisclosed number of small boys who were also forced by this cheeky boy to repeat his actions on the abused girls.This means the seven girls and the boys who were forced to take turns to abuse the minor girls all need special psychological support.From information gathered, the issue is still under wraps as parents and guardians of the affected and infected children do not want the matter to be made public.Yes, it s within their rights not to be forced to disclose the new HIV status of their children, but it s also the rights of these minors to be accorded the best medical and psychological support following the unfortunate incident.The issues of sexual abuse are traumatising and they leave permanent marks that need professional cancelling since the victims live with the condition for the rest of their lives.Although some people might think that the incident does not affect them because they live in urban centres, we implore parents and guardians in both urban and rural areas to be on the look of situations that leave children vulnerable to abuse.Parents should ensure that they drop their children in school premises every morning, if possible, leave the minors in the custody of their teachers. We know that parents are busy with work and other businesses that makes it impossible for them to collect the children from schools.When that happens, there is a need to have an arrangement where their maids are tasked with such responsibilities. Some parents from a particular suburb are encouraged to take turns to drop or pick up their children if they attend the same school.Child abusers come in different forms that include relatives, schoolmates and neighbours among others. It is the responsibility of all parents and guardians to create environments that ensure that their children are protected from abuse.Those without family cars should make sure that their children prefer public passengers transport rather private motorists.In rural areas given that the children travel long distances, makes it difficult for parents and guardians to accompany their children to and from schools daily.However, it is prudent that they encourage those in junior grades to wait for their brothers and sisters who dismiss late so that they travel home in larger groups. It should also be the responsibility of teachers and parents to always hammer the message of abuse to children so that they report all suggestive behaviour by their schoolmates, relatives and neighbours.It is the responsibility of everyone to protect innocent children from any form of abuse.
