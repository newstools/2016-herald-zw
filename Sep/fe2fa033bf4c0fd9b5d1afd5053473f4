BARCELONA. Barcelona coach Luis Enrique insists Neymar s skills should be enjoyed rather than criticised after the Brazilian s penchant for showboating once again came under the spotlight. Former Barca and Real Madrid midfielder Michael Laudrup controversially slammed Neymar for displaying his full range of tricks towards the end of Barca s 5-1 thrashing of newly promoted Leganes on Saturday. Ney has his own style, a style I think is spectacular for football. We enjoy it a lot at Barcelona, Enrique said on the eve of Barca s blockbuster La Liga clash with Atletico Madrid today. There are many players that interpret football like that. It is a cultural thing more common in South American and particularly Brazilian players, added Enrique. It is something that shouldn t surprise anyone in Spanish football. AFP.&nbsp;
