Long queues, empty ATMs and withdrawal limits why not beat the queue with alternative payments? It s convenience at your fingertips! There are many ways to pay your ZOL Zimbabwe subscription: through your bank, in cash or with a third-party bill payment service to name but a few. There are advantages and disadvantages to each, so the method you choose depends on your personal preferences and current circumstances. First things first, how does the ZOL billing cycle work?The ZOL billing cycle runs from the first day of each month up to the last day of the same month. ZOL is on a full calendar month billing cycle and NOT anniversary billing.Depending on the commencement date of your service, you may receive a prorated invoice in the first month.For example, if you are subscribing to a $89 monthly package (Fibroniks Family Essentials) and you commence service on the June 16, 2016, you will receive a prorated invoice from that date to June 30, 2016.Assuming you had paid $89, the remaining credit balance, ($44,50) on your account will be passed on to your July invoice.Also note that, you will receive your data in full for the package which you would have signed up for despite the prorating of your initial bill.For the subsequent periods, i.e. commencing May 1, 2016, we will then start to bill you on a full calendar month basis from the first day of each month up to the last day of the same month.However, the amount payable in May will be $89, less the April credit hence you will be required to pay a top up before May 1, 2016 to normalise your account.There s no need to be without your internet this month!Beat the queues!
