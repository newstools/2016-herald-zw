The new Ford Ranger 2.2 autoTinashe Makichi: MotoringCorrespondentThe new Ford Ranger is set to establish new benchmarks in the light commercial vehicle segment with an uncompromised blend of robust capability, craftsmanship and advanced technology. The new Ford Ranger brings a new level of comfort and refinement to its segment without compromising on the rugged capability that our customers demand and have come to appreciate from the current model. It represents a smarter kind of tough, and will help motorists to achieve more in every type of application. The current Ranger is one of the toughest, most capable pick-ups out there, and this is reflected in the exceptional sales of the Ranger in Sub-Saharan Africa which have increased significantly since it was launched in 2011.The new Ranger continues to be produced at Ford s Silverton Assembly Plant in Pretoria and exported to 148 markets in Africa and Europe. The Duratorq TDCi engines are manufactured at the Struandale Engine Plant in Port Elizabeth.The changes to the new Ranger begin with an updated exterior design. A bold, more modern look lends Ranger a powerful presence on the road, and immediately conveys a sense of capability. A more muscular hood flows into a strong new trapezoidal grille, which connects seamlessly with the chiselled projector headlamps, accentuating the new Ranger s width and strong stance.When you look at how motorists use their vehicles, it s important that a Ranger looks and functions as a tough, dependable tool.The updated exterior has been combined with a stylish new interior on the new XLT, Wildtrak and Limited versions that creates an even more comfortable, contemporary and car-like environment for the driver and passengers. Strong horizontal lines run across the width of the cab, giving a sense of spaciousness, creating a clear distinction between the upper and lower levels, and placing the focus on the central eight-inch touchscreen.Behind the steering wheel, a new dual-TFT instrument cluster provides drivers with information about the vehicle, as well as entertainment, climate control and mobile phone features at a glance.The new Ford Ranger remains one of the most capable pick-ups in its class. With an exceptional 800mm water wading depth, and with 230mm of ground clearance, it is designed and engineered to handle the most extreme terrains with ease.The new Ranger achieves all this with a level of refinement not usually seen in the pick-up segment. While the current Ranger already sets the standard for ride and handling, Ford engineers fine-tuned the suspension of the new version for additional comfort and even better handling.The driving experience is further enhanced by an electric power-assisted steering system, which provides precise steering with a natural and confident feel. With EPAS, steering is light and manageable for low-speed manoeuvring, such as parking, and precise at higher speeds.The level of assistance varies based on speed, steering wheel angle, cornering forces and acceleration or deceleration. Furthermore, by eliminating the power steering pump used in a traditional power-steering system, EPAS also results in a quieter vehicle and improves fuel efficiency by about three percent.Engineers fitted the new Ranger with advanced sound-deadening materials and improved insulation for one of the quietest and most comfortable cabin interiors in its class.A host of cutting-edge technologies are available on the new Ford Ranger to help drivers stay connected and in control.SYNC2, the latest generation of Ford s in-car connectivity system, gives drivers smarter and safer ways to stay connected and is standard on the new Ranger XLT and Wildtrak. Using natural voice commands, like temperature 20 degrees , play AC/DC or call John , the driver can control the car s climate controls, entertainment system and phone functions more easily than ever before. An eight-inch touch screen places more controls at the driver s fingertips, with colour-coded corners for easy menu navigation.New Wildtrak and Limited models are equipped with Tyre Pressure Monitoring System, electro chromatic rear-view mirror, Front and Rear Park Assist, Rear-view Camera, Power Convertor and load box illumination on the sports bar.The new Ranger s impressive power, capability, and payload and towing capacity are made possible thanks to the latest generation of powerful, more refined and fuel-efficient Duratorq TDCi diesel engines, as well as the proven Duratec petrol unit. These engines provide new Ranger customers with a winning combination of power and efficiency in all conditions, and help to underscore Ford s fun-to-drive promise.The capable and economical 2.2-litre Duratorq TDCi four-cylinder diesel engine remains part of the line-up, available in mid-power 92kW (125PS)/320Nm guise, or the high-power version with 110kW (150PS) and 375Nm. Combined with the addition of EPAS and the use of a longer final drive ratio, this reduces fuel consumption.The new Ranger is also available with Ford s dependable 2.5-litre Duratec petrol engine, providing 122kW (163PS) of power and 226 Nm of torque.Depending on model derivative, the new Ranger is equipped with a six-speed manual or automatic transmission, or a five-speed manual on the petrol versions.The new Ford Ranger is available in a wide range of models and specification levels, spanning a total of 42 models across the left-hand drive markets in the SSA region.A total of seven single cab derivatives are on offer, spanning the Base 2,5 petrol and 2,2L diesel through to the 2,2 XL+ 4&#215;4 Manual. The RAP Cab is available in a 2,2 4&#215;4 XLT version.
