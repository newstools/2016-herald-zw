Section 80 of the Income Tax Act (Chapter: 23:06) provides for the deduction of 10 percent Withholding Tax from all amounts payable to all persons who enter into contracts with the State or a statutory body, a quasi-Government institution and taxpayers who are registered with the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (Zimra), unless a payee furnishes the paying officer with a valid Tax Clearance Certificate.What does a Contract mean? Contract means an agreement in terms of which the State or a statutory body, quasi-governmental institution or registered taxpayer is obliged to pay one or more persons an amount or amounts totalling or aggregating US$1 000 or more.When is the amount withheld remitted to Zimra?The amount withheld should be remitted to the Commissioner General of Zimra on or before the 10th day of the month following that in which the payment was made.The payment should be accompanied by a schedule showing all names of the persons from whom the 10 percent was deducted and attached to the prescribed form (Rev 5) and submitted to Zimra.Withholding Tax CertificatesAny paying officer who has withheld any amount, should furnish the payee concerned with a Withholding Tax Certificate.The format of the certificate should be in a form approved by the Commissioner General of Zimra, and should clearly show the gross amount withheld.Crediting of Withholding TaxesThe Commissioner General of Zimra retains any withholding amount remitted to him until the Income Tax payable by the payee for the year of assessment has been assessed.The amount shall be allowed as a credit against the Income Tax payable by the payee.
