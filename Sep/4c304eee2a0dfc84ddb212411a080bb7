Roselyne Sachiti : Features EditorEfforts by African countries to increase investments in the Global Fund as global health partners seek to galvanise all sources of funding to end AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria as epidemics, and to build resilient and sustainable systems for health are a move in the right direction. This increased contribution is most welcome as it proves how African countries continue to take developmental issues seriously at a time donor fatigue has reached worrying levels.With Zimbabwe and many other African countries still requiring Global Fund support to effectively combat HIV and Aids, tuberculosis and malaria among populations at risk, commitment by the most affected countries goes to show that if we are to reach our 90-90-90 targets by 2020, it is no longer business as usual.It is fact that funding to most health programmes by international donors has gone down over the years and this has had an impact on current HIV programming in most Third World countries, especially those in Africa. Chilling reports of rising numbers of new HIV infections globally are coming as data reveal donor funding has declined to its lowest levels since 2010.According to UNAIDS, international donor contributions dropped from a peak of $9,7 billion in 2013 to 8,1 billion in 2015. Low- and middle-income countries are stepping up to fill the gap, with domestic resources accounting for 57 percent of the $19,2 billion total funding in 2015.The recent contributions by African countries that include Benin, C te d Ivoire, Kenya, Namibia, Nigeria, Senegal, South Africa, Togo, and Zimbabwe to the Global Fund s Fifth Replenishment, hosted by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau of Canada in Montreal between September 16 and 17 will put to ease these worries.Given that the Montreal conference secured pledges of more than $12,9 billion from partners across the world, Africa s contribution, no matter what fraction, is important and our leaders should be applauded.Just last week, Zimbabwe committed $1 million to the fund, and during the last replenishment in 2012, the country also contributed another $1 million.Since the inception of the Global Fund to end Aids, TB and Malaria Zimbabwe has been awarded grants totaling $1,57 billion.The Global Fund s current grants to Zimbabwe total $709 million, of which $611 million goes to HIV and Aids, $59 million to malaria and $39 million to TB, over the period 2014 to 2017.According to statistics from the Ministry of Health and Child Care, Aids and Tuberculosis Unit, the country has made tremendous progress towards ending AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.The number of children infected through mother to child has gone down to below 6 percent and HIV deaths have also gone down from a high of 184 000 a year to about 29 000.However, an estimated 1,4 million people are living with HIV. Of those living with HIV only 920 000 are on treatment, half of whom are funded by the Global Fund.This is why Africa s contribution to this fund becomes vital.Pledges by African countries to the Global Fund are aligned with a far more significant increase of domestic investment in health by African countries -$10,9 billion committed for 2015-17.For the first time, Africa is now mobilising more domestic funding for health than foreign funding in the sector.Specific pledges to the Global Fund signal commitment beyond any specific country, towards a global approach to ending the epidemics.African leaders pledges show the depth and desire to end Aids by 2020.What African presidents saidPresident Mugabe in making Zimbabwe s contribution said: In 2012, in the last replenishment, our country committed $1 million to the fund and subsequently met its obligation. As we all move towards another replenishment, we realise the importance and value of supporting this noble endeavour. I therefore on behalf of Zimbabwe commit $1 million toward this replenishment effort. President Faure Gnassingb of Togo, making his nation s first contribution to the Global Fund of US$1 million, said Togo will play its part in the fight against epidemics to end them for good.President Macky Sall of Senegal said: In an interconnected and interdependent world, diseases know no borders. He added: New impetus is needed to continue support to the countries affected by diseases. These countries should also invest more in the health sector so we can end these diseases for good. President Alassane Ouattara of Cote d Ivoire also pledged $1 million to the Global Fund, and spoke about the importance of focusing investments in programmes that specifically address the disproportionate effects on women and girls.President Uhuru Kenyatta of Kenya, when he announced a pledge of $5 million just prior to the replenishment conference, said his country was contributing the funds in the spirit of solidarity and shared responsibility in the fight against diseases. The funds, which will be invested in prevention and treatment of diseases and in building health systems, will save lives and create more inclusive and thriving communities, President Kenyatta said.And as Mark Dybul, Executive Director of the Global Fund, puts it more investments in health by African countries have helped build remarkable momentum against HIV, tuberculosis and malaria &#8211; some of Africa s most devastating diseases.In fact, when African leaders make investing in health a top priority, they become strong partners in a global movement that is determined to expand access to health services to everyone, leaving no one behind.The replenishment conference raised nearly $1 billion more than the previous pledging session in 2013, and benefited from participation by leaders from countries all over the world, including the heads of state of Senegal, C te d Ivoire and Togo and the prime ministers of Mali and Guinea.The amount raised will save eight million lives, avert 300 million infections, and help build resilient and sustainable systems for health. The conference is the beginning of a three-year replenishment period, and the Global Fund will work to gain further contributions in the coming months and years, with strong advocacy by civil society and partners worldwide.Since 2002, the Global Fund has consistently proven that it is one of the most impactful investments a donor can make in global health. By continually innovating to make health products more affordable and accessible, and identifying new approaches for prevention and treatment, the Global Fund has delivered incredible results &#8211; in lives saved and money spent.Donors like the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation have also joined other global leaders in increasing support for the Global Fund by pledging up to $600 million for the 2017-2019 budget cycle. This includes $100 million in matching funds with the UK s private sector malaria matching challenge and up to $100 million to unlock other private sector contributions, $50 million of which will go to (RED).&nbsp;Feedback: [email&#160;protected] &lt;mailto:[email&#160;protected]&gt;
