BENONI. Temba Bavuma made a century on his one-day international cricket debut to set up a comfortable 206-run win for South Africa in a one-off one-day international against Ireland at Willowmoore Park yesterday. Bavuma hit 113 in a total of 354 for five after South Africa were sent in to bat. Ireland were bowled out for 148 in reply.Ireland captain Will Porterfield s gamble did not pay off as Bavuma and Quinton de Kock (82) punished the Irish bowling in an opening partnership of 159. Porterfield described his team s performance as disappointing and bemoaned early chances which went astray. JP Duminy and Farhaan Behardien both hit rapid half-centuries to take South Africa to a total that always looked likely to be well beyond Ireland s reach. Porterfield was out to Kagiso Rabada without scoring to the second ball of the Ireland innings and the visitors crumbled despite good innings of 40 by Paul Stirling and 41 by Kevin O Brien. AFP.
