MADRID. Fernando Torres believes Atletico Madrid travel to Barcelona tonight at just the right time after emphatically bouncing back with three wins over the past week. The showdown is the first major clash of the Spanish La Liga soccer season, but despite their free-scoring form, both sides face the prospect of being cut adrift from league leaders Real Madrid even at this early stage. It s a good time to visit Barcelona, Torres said after netting twice in Atletico s 5-0 thrashing of Sporting Gijon on Saturday. It seems like they are playing as we have become accustomed to. They are the most difficult opponent we have faced in the last few years without a doubt and we know how difficult it will be. But when you are winning and playing well it always gives you that little more confidence. Atletico scored 10 times and kept three clean sheets in seeing off Celta Vigo, PSV Eindhoven and Sporting in eight days.However, they already trail city rivals Real by four points after disappointing draws against Alaves and Leganes to open the campaign. We just needed to find the goals because we have been consistent in the way we have played despite the two draws in the first two games, added Torres. The team is confident and now we have the toughest game we have had until now.
