Paidamoyo Chipunza Senior Health ReporterHealth and Child Care Minister Dr David Parirenyatwa (pictured)has urged health stakeholders to support the annual Health Expo that provides a platform to share knowledge and experiences on new trends in the health sector. Speaking at this year s official opening of the expo in Harare yesterday, Dr Parirenyatwa said this was important especially now that the world was faced with tremendous challenges in health service delivery.He said no individual or single institution could overcome these challenges, hence the need for efforts from all stakeholders. The solution will not come from one individual or even one country. What these trying times call for is a holistic but synergistic coming together of all stakeholders &#8211; each contributing his little part to the solution, said Dr Parirenyatwa.He said for that reason, this year s Health Expo included a platform for conferencing where areas around health financing, new innovations and e-health were deliberated on. I would like to enjoin us all to see the opportunities in the challenges we face and not to see the problems in our opportunities, he said.Organised by Zim &#8211; Afro in partnership with the Health Advisor in the Office of the President and Cabinet, Dr Timothy Stamps, the three-day fair ran under the theme: access to health for all by 2030.Manufacturers, suppliers, buyers, service providers and consumers, the majority of which were from Zimbabwe, attended the expo.Zim-Afro director Mr Shepherd Chakanza acknowledged support the event received from different stakeholders over the years. We, however, still have a lot of stakeholders missing in this event and we would like to appeal to them to take part in this worthy cause so that whatever solutions we come up with from this gathering impact positively on our health delivery system, he said.
