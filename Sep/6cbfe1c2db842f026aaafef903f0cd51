Robson Sharuko Senior Sports Editor WISDOM MUTASA drove a dagger into the heart of a father pleading for salvation with a horror miss, in the penalty shootout of this Chibuku Super Cup first round tie, probably writing the final page of the divorce papers likely to be signed soon between his dad Lloyd and a Dynamos side set to end a miserable season empty-handed. The younger Mutasa s failure from 11 metres, with his tame effort well saved by keeper Donovan Bernard, in the drama of that shootout, provided a fitting end to a poor afternoon for the midfielder.But the consequences, in terms of preserving his father s job, could be disastrous with the older Mutasa now a sitting duck waiting for the executioners to simply pull the trigger.After a largely poor show, with every minute he spent on the pitch in that second half at Rufaro yesterday sparking frustration among the DeMbare fans in the stands, which exploded into rebellion every time he wasn t the player who was substituted by the under-pressure coach, Wisdom was provided with the perfect stage to repay the faith his father had invested in him in that storm of disapproval.With the scores tied at 4-4, after the first eight players had converted from the penalty spot, Wisdom took responsibility to deal with the pressure of taking the fifth penalty, the last of his team s five regulated kicks, as Rufaro &#8211; which had turned on him all day, having long picked him out as the pantomime villain &#8211; held its breath.That they never believed in him, to find both the composure and efficiency to convert from the spot, after a torrid afternoon in which the relationship between the fans and the player had been tested, if not broken, was clearly visible.And the Dynamos fans fears soon turned into reality as Wisdom, his confidence having been drained by the combination of a poor show and the brutality of the rejection he suffered from his fans, drove the ball to the left of the keeper.Too close to Bernard and too weak to beat him for pace and the How Mine goalminder accepted the gift.It was difficult not to feel for Wisdom, a player that DeMbare had moved mountains to woo from a ZPC Kariba reluctant to release him, tasting the Glamour Boys patience for weeks as the drama rumbled on, and as he took his walk of shame, back to his teammates, the agony was written all over his face.To their credit, his teammates did not disown him, even when it was apparent his mistake could virtually end their season, and they embraced him and that he didn t cry, amid the tsunami of emotions that exploded in his frame, showed he was made of sterner stuff.And it s a character he will need in abundance to bounce back from this setback.To suggest that Wisdom was the only poor player, yesterday, in the blue-and-white Dynamos colours, would be an insult to the virtues of honesty on which every analysis should be built on.The reality, and that is what should worry the DeMbare family long after they have gone the painful post-mortem of another demoralising defeat, is that these Glamour Boys have the look, and feel, of a collection of damaged goods.Too many ordinary players, lack of leaders, too many stray passes, lack of conviction, too many basic errors and lack of cohesion all combined to present the true picture of what these misfiring Glamour Boys are a team that has destroyed the fear that used to be associated with the country s biggest and most successful football club.A week after they failed to hold on to their lead at Barbourfields and, for the first time in a decade, were whitewashed by eternal rivals Highlanders in a league match, Dynamos could not find the response they needed to win this game for a good Cup run that would have masked their dire season of under-achievement.Instead, they were bullied in the midfield by the outstanding Makundika Sikala, a towering presence in the key department who dominated it as if he was playing at Luveve and not Rufaro, while the man they rejected, Victor Kamhuka, provided the solidity in defence which the poor DeMbare attack could not beat over 90 minutes.How Mine completed more passes, played with a better rhythm and energy and would have been full value for a victory if they had stolen it in regulation time.They hunted in packs, were more of a team than a Dynamos side that resembled a loose collection of individuals overwhelmed by the pressure of playing for this giant, and while Denver Mukamba did try to produce some magic, his impact was limited, he didn t impose himself on the game and would disappear for long periods to really hurt the opponent.The best chance of a largely poor afternoon fell to the visitors but Warriors keeper, Tatenda Mukuruva, made himself big and pulled out a stunning save in the second half which won universal approval from the fans.Mukuruva was needed, by his team, in that penalty shootout, to keep them in the game after Wisdom s miss, with Praise Tonha needing to convert to send How Mine through.Lloyd Mutasa played some mind games, summoning his keeper for some last-ditch instructions, and it worked as Tonha, just like Wisdom before him, sent his shot close to the keeper who saved with the ball boys turning it into an amateur game as they all ran onto the field to congratulate Mukuruva for buying his team another life.But Mukuruva turned villain, a few minutes later, when his spot kick, the first in the sudden death lottery, was saved while his national teammate, Bernard fired his effort home with conviction to give the miners victory as Dynamos, for the second week running, fell to a Bulawayo team.As the Glamour Boys left the field, they waved to their fans, thanking them for their support, but the supporters rejected that gesture in a show of anger at what their team has become.Football is a cruel game, and it s something that Wisdom and Lloyd Mutasa now know, after the events of yesterday.Two years ago, Wisdom stroked home the winning penalty, in the shootout against Dynamos, to give an FC Platinum, coached by his father Lloyd, victory in the Independence Cup in fading light at the National Sports Stadium.That gave birth to that iconic image of father and son, sobbing with joy, as they celebrated their victory.Yesterday, the gods of football cursed them and, for Lloyd, this could be the beginning of the end of his latest dance with the Glamour Boys while Wisdom will have to fight hard to win over the fans.
