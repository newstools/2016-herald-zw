Petros Kausiyo : Deputy Sports EditorPREMIER Soccer League clubs have embraced the proposed Sports Medial Aid Society with the top-flight body s chairman Peter Dube yesterday optimistic that it could herald a new era in the manner in which the teams cater for the well-being of players. The development also dovetails with the audacious bid by the Minister of Sport and Recreation Makhosini Hlongwane to unveil countrywide health and fitness centres. The Premiership as the country s flagship sporting league has taken the lead in seeking ways to prevent injuries, treatment and rehabilitation of players and cater for the welfare of those who would have been injured through a medical aid scheme designated specifically for sport.Sweeney Mushonga, a representative of the institution made the presentation to the 16 Premiership clubs and told them that the Sports Medical Aid Society, has already gone into partnership with a reputable insurance company to provide services to the football fraternity and other sports associations in the country. Sports Medical Aid Society was granted an operating licence by the Ministry of Health and Child Welfare as the society seeks to extend medical aid cover to the sporting fraternity which currently does not enjoy tailor made services, Mushonga said.Dube in welcoming the setting up of the medical aid society said the development would bring huge relief to the top clubs as it will roll out medical schemes that will benefit players.The PSL boss in welcoming the scheme said, it was now up to the clubs to leverage on the window of opportunity they had been provided. It certainly was an eye opener (the presentation on the medical aid scheme). It made everyone reflect on how they have been operating. Clubs are operating under tough economic conditions and anything that always looks to lessen the financial burden on them is most welcome. I see this scheme as something that brings relief to the clubs and I am happy that it was well received by the club representatives who attended the presentation in Harare. Anything that brings some relief is sure to be welcomed. Generally health matters can be contentious not just in football, but in any industry. We have said to Sports Medical Aid Society that is very good and now the representatives are going back to report to their respective clubs. I have already done so at Highlanders through the secretary, Dube said.Dube said he had been noting with concern the fact that some clubs were struggling to get their injured players access to proper treatment as they would not have the always have the financial resources at hand at the time the injuries occur.There have been incidences too where local players would have been injured at match venues, are turned away at some Emergency Medical Rooms for failing to have cash on hand or a reputable medical aid scheme.But Dube, who is also the Highlanders chairman is hopeful that once fully operational the Sports Medical Aid Society would also provide the cushion that clubs have been long yearning for.That Sports Medical Aid Society are coming on board having partnered an international company of repute could have also convinced the Premiership clubs that it is the genuine article they needed to turn on a new chapter for football.In the brochure they presented to the top clubs and which has also been sent to domestic rugby sides, the Sports Medical Aid Society focuses on prevention of injuries, treatment and rehabilitation, pre-season examination and an emergency action plan.There is also a provision for some of the complicated injuries to be treated in India at identified facilities, hospitals and specialists while dental services will also be catered for.Mushonga said the society had also taken into account the challenges Premiership clubs and other sporting teams and institutions were facing in a tough operating environment before laying out their schemes. The society is fully cognisant of the challenges facing this segment and after careful feasibility assessments, has come up with a product, which has been designed to meet the needs of the sporting fraternity.
