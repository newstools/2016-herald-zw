The awards were the culmination of a draw conducted in April for students and schools which participated in STEM through the enrolment of relevant subjects.One student won a trip to Silicon Valley in the United States of America, while 10 others each won laptops and another 10 walked away with iPads.Speaking at the ceremony, Junior President Tineyi Mbavari encouraged the prize winners to use the laptops and iPads for research and school pur- poses. The prizes given out here today are not for you to waste on social interactions but rather to increase your spectra in the science field.
