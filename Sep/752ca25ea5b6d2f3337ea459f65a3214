The New Jaguar F PaceTinashe Makichi: Motoring CorrespondentThe New Jaguar F Pace made its debut on the Sub Saharan Market two months ago and immediately took over the SUV market by a storm.The much awaited F Pace is the newest member of the Jaguar family, the first Jaguar SUV and the first aluminium- intensive model in its class. The F Pace has exciting proportions, a dynamic stance and you can easily notice that it s a Jaguar! The most remarkable thing about the F Pace is its appearance which has been influenced by the F Type. Every Jaguar should draw your eye from a 200metre radius and I believe the new F Pace s presence on the road is second to none in its class said Ian Callum director of Design, Jaguar.Elements such as the slender full-LED headlights, forged 22-inch wheels, and the bold upright front grille reinforces the new F Pace s all surface potential and its Aero dynamic efficiency. The sleek headlights, available with adaptive full-LED technology, feature daytime running lights which give the vehicle its foxy look and are an exceptionally smooth and homogeneous light source.As you drive the F Pace you can feel its superb handling capabilities and that it is light and easily gains momentum. This is attributed by the light stiff body structure which comprises of 80 per cent aluminium, and is the only aluminium intensive monocoque in the segment.Additional weight savings come from the composite tailgate and magnesium for parts such as the cross-car beam.The F Pace provides a quiet and smooth ride and as you drive it you can feel the sophistication and you easily derive immense driving pleasure.The F-PACE is a true five-seater with a spacious, luxurious interior featuring the premium materials, craftsmanship and meticulous attention to detail.Infotainment technology is just as advanced in the F Pace and it is tailor made to suit anyone. I liked the fact that you can link your smart phone for better integration.It has the premium In Control Touch Pro system which is based around a 10.2-inch touch-screen and an intuitive user interface with graphics that are sharp and very responsive.It has a state of the art navigation system which shows on the 12.3 inch HD virtual instrument cluster you can easily enter the address of the place where you want to go and within a few seconds you are on you way!You can embark on an off road expedition and you can tell that the F Pace was meticulously engineered to handle the rough terrain, such that the wheel and tyre combination offers the optimum balance and resistance.The 22 inch wheels which are unique in this vehicle segment give the F Pace high levels of on road dynamics and traction on challenging surfaces.The F Pace is available in four models, i.e. the F Pace Pure, The F Pace R. Sport, The F Pace S, and The F Pace First Edition.The All-New F-PACE is equipped with Jaguar s powerful and efficient supercharged V6 petrol engines. With a choice of either 250kW or 280kW which offer breath taking performance. The automatic transmissions offer smooth, seamless shifts, while the All-Wheel Drive system delivers a peerless driving experience.For adrenalin junkies you will fall in love with the 250kw and 280 kW, 3.0 litre super charged V6 engines which shares its engine with the F type sports car.The F Pace offers an array of technologies all needed to make the journeys easier and safer, from traction systems to get you moving on low friction surfaces to an emergency braking system that can recognise pedestrians.It has an All surface Progress Control mechanism which assist the vehicle to move forward in difficult conditions. The Low Friction Launch makes the most of the vehicle s traction capability by taking control of the throttle.The SUV features a host of driver assistance technologies to make day to day driving less stressful and more pleasurable. Adaptive Cruise Control allows the F Pace to automatically match its cruise speed to the vehicle ahead and maintain a safe following distance.Park Assist complements the built-in camera systems too by using sensors to find empty parking spots and autonomously manoeuvre the F-PACE in even the trickiest situations. Meanwhile, Reverse Traffic Detection warns drivers of approaching traffic when exiting parking spots issuing visual and audible signals to warn drivers of hazards.For the driver who has an active lifestyle Jaguar has designed a water proof, shockproof wrist band with an integrated transponder.The driver can leave the key fob inside and use the activity key to lock and open the car. The exciting thing about the Activity band is that you can swim, surf and jog whilst you are wearing it and when you want to open the car you hold it close to the letter J of the Jaguar lettering at the tail gate and the car will open! The F Pace also comes with gesture control which is the first of its kind on an SUV.The Jaguar SUV is now available on the Zimbabwean market, at Premier Auto Services , the authorised Jaguar dealer
