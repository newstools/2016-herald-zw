We have done all the paperwork and payments and it very easy adding a country on a list of other countries since this is a tour, said Matondo.Matondo added that the Morgans requested more time in Zimbabwe as they intend to tour the country.Another reason for the change of dates was clash on the venues as Manyuchi boxing match is going to be held at the very same place.Morgan Heritage is going on an African tour dubbed Strictly Roots Africa and will be performing in Kenya, Uganda, and Reunion Island but first in Zimbabwe.Strictly Roots is Morgan Heritage s 10th studio album released March 31, 2015 and it earned them a Grammy award for the Best Reggae Album 2016.Matondo said as much as it expensive to bring Morgan Heritage to Zimbabwe on this tour, it was going to be far more expensive to bring them directly to Zimbabwe.Tickets will go on sell on Thursday and for $10-$20 at any Colorsel Shops all around the city.However, the $10 tickets are going to be limited and will soon be sold at $15, Matondo asserted. There are people who were complaining that the tickets are too cheap for Morgan Heritage and for HICC so as soon as the $10 tickets are sold out, people can start buying at $15, he said.Matondo shared his excitement on bringing the iconic Morgan Heritage although this is not the first group he has brought to Zimbabwe.He said, I am happy that I am doing this but I brought Mafikizolo here, we brought Cassper Nyovest to Bulawayo last year and Jah P s Fill up the HICC so yes I am happy that I am bringing promotions to another level with my partner Tariro Mapfumo. Morgan Heritage will share the stage with Oliver Mtukudzi, Winky D and Freeman.
