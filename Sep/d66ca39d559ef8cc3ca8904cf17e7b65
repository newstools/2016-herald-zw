Ntando Mahlangu has become South Africa s sixth medallist at the Paralympic Games in Rio. The 14-year-old athlete, who was born with hemi-melia and underdeveloped limbs, had to have his legs amputated in 2012, after he had been in a wheelchair his life. Just four years after he first learnt how to walk, 14-year-old Mahlangu stood on a podium to receive his first Paralympic medal.Using a set of prosthetic blades, he hurtled to silver last night in the men s 200m. He also broke the African record with a time of 23.77 in the race for above-the-knee amputees.Ntando received his artificial legs soon after his legs were amputated but he had to learn to walk all over again. It took me a week to learn to walk on them, and after two weeks I was able to run. I felt good when I was able to play soccer with my friends, the Jiangxi-born runner told the Sunday Times. It was lekker. Although he actually prefers the 400m race, Ntando proved equally adept in the 200m race. I knew that once I got into my stride that I would be okay, he said after his spectacular performance. I thought it could do well. It s not my preferred distance, but I showed that I can run fast over 200m as well as 400m. Youmagazine.
