Freeman Razemba: Crime ReporterTHE upsurge in murder cases countrywide as a result of petty issues which can easily be avoided, continue to worry police as people are now clearly not valuing the sanctity of human life. The petty issues include arguments during beer drink, fights over small amounts of money especially coins and infidelity, among others. During the past few months police have been conducting awareness campaigns urging people to respect the sanctity of life and avoid settling disputes through violent means.Chief police spokesperson Senior Assistant Commissioner Charity Charamba recently said the police envisage an environment where there are no murder cases in the country. Most of the cases involve minor issues that could have been solved or avoided. Drunkenness also contributed to some of the cases, she said.Snr Asst Comm Charamba said; We have noted a disturbing trend where either a husband or wife kills his or her children before committing suicide because of either a domestic dispute or other differences, she said.She added that parents should know that children have a right to life and should be protected.She urged members of the public to seek counselling from the police, churches, elders and traditional leaders instead of taking the law into their own hands.Snr Asst Comm Charamba said police were embarking on awareness campaigns to educate people against domestic violence.According to new a research by psychologists, people who commit familicide or uxoricide have a significantly different psychological profile than murderers who kill strangers.In Zimbabwe the increased cases of murder are all too worrying and reported cases prove this.An example is the case of a 36-year-old Magunje man who faces murder charges for allegedly striking and killing his uncle with a log. The uncle had taken the man to a prophet for alleged deliverance from evil spirits.Cover Warasi, of Plot No. 40, Village 4 Lazy 5, Kasimure in Hurungwe, was not asked to plead when he appeared before Karoi magistrate Mr Obedience Matare facing charges of killing his father s brother Goodluck Manyepa a fortnight ago.He was remanded in custody to September 30.It is alleged that soon after arrival from a prophet where Manyepa had taken Warasi for deliverance on September 13, the accused went berserk and struck his unsuspecting uncle several times on the head with a log.Manyepa, who bled profusely, was rushed to Chinhoyi Provincial Hospital where he was pronounced dead on arrival.
