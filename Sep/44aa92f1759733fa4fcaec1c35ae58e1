Walter Mswazie Masvingo Correspondent THE Zanu-PF leadership in Masvingo has so far mobilised 50 beasts for the 16th Annual National People s Conference slated for December.Acting provincial chairman Cde Amasa Nhenjana said preparations for the conference were progressing smoothly with the executive committee regularly meeting to check on progress. Cde Nhenjana said the actual dates for the conference were yet to be announced, but the party s supreme body, the Politburo, endorsed the Masvingo Show Grounds as the venue.He said with three months to go before the event, the committee has sourced 50 beasts and transport to ferry members to and from the venue. Out of the 50 beasts, 45 were pledged by a senior provincial executive member while five others will come from a Politburo member, said Cde Nhenjana.He said a number of stakeholders have started responding with the fundraising team already receiving donations both in cash and kind.Cde Nhenjana noted that organisations were pledging on their own volition and rubbished reports from some sections of the media that portray a bad picture of the whole mobilisation process.He said Zanu-PF has friends who always came to the aid of the party at crucial times. We are already seeing the advantages of having friends as a party. Individuals and organisations are responding positively to our call for donations. We are happy that our party heavyweights that include Politburo member Cde Josiah Hungwe and Chiefs Council president Chief Fortune Charumbira are doing a great job. We endeavour to make the conference one of the best as we did for the 21st February Movement celebrations, Cde Nhenjana said.Masvingo was chosen to host the 16th Annual National People s Conference after successfully hosting President Mugabe s 92nd birthday bash at the Great Zimbabwe monuments in February where over 80 000 people attended.The province last hosted the Annual National People s Conference at Masvingo Teachers College in 2003.
