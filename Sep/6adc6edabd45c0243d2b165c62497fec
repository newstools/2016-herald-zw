LONDON Arsenal hero Ian Wright has revealed that he lost respect for Sir Alex Ferguson when the former Manchester United boss accused him of playing the race card . During two particularly hostile clashes between the Gunners and Red Devils in the 1996-97 season, Wright twice clashed with United keeper Peter Schmeichel. The second altercation, at Highbury, saw Wright jump in studs first on the Danish keeper, seen as something of a revenge attack following their first encounter at Old Trafford three months previously.That was followed by an argument as the pair headed down the tunnel, with Wright having to be restrained by Arsenal physio Gary Lewin. Now Wright, in an extract from his new autobiography Ian Wright: A Life In Football , has revealed words shared with Ferguson following the second incident left a sour taste.Wright writes: In November 1996 during a game he (Schmeichel) yelled at me, You f***ing black b*****d (something Schmeichel has always denied). The following February, I did go in hard on Schmeichel, but he made a meal of it. After the second game, I met Alex Ferguson. He said: I never had you as a race card player. The Mirror.&nbsp;
