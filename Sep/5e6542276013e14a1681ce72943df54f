With Messi we are stronger, but we will continue being strong If the Argentinian s early departure was not bad enough, Bar a failed to make up ground on the La Liga leaders Real Madrid, whose unbeaten start had been halted earlier in the evening when they could only draw at home with Villarreal.Barcelona seemed to be on course to cut Real s lead to one point when Ivan Rakitic headed home a cross by Andres Iniesta in the 41st minute.But Diego Simeone s side were dogged opponents and scored the equaliser their efforts deserved when the substitute ngel Correa got the better of Javier Mascherano to slide a precise shot past Marc-Andre Ter Stegen in the 61st minute. Messi had Barcelona s first effort in the 14th minute but it was comfortably saved Jan Oblak while for Atl tico, who were content to play on the break, Yannick Ferreira Carrasco tested Ter Stegen with an angled drive after a quarter of an hour.
