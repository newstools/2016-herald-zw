He is the man on the ball and we all feed into him. They should bury the hatchet and stop waging wars on each other, that will only drift the party further apart, said Cde Kasukuwere.Factional fights in the Midlands province led to the suspension of the then provincial chairperson Cde Kizito Chivamba a few months ago.
