Sport ReporterCAPS United chief executive Cuthbert Chitima yesterday said the disturbances which occurred just before kick-off of their Chibuku Super Cup first round match against Tsholotsho at the National Sports Stadium could have been a result of a communication breakdown between the players and the management. The match started half-an-hour late after the Green Machine players had threatened a boycott over outstanding dues for the previous month.Makepekepe lost the match 4-5 on a penalty shoot-out following a 1-1 draw with the visitors, who advanced to the quarter-finals of the 16-team tournament as one of the surprise packages.Chitima, while acknowledging the delays in the payment of the outstanding dues, yesterday said the issues had been ironed out and the team was back in training in preparation of a crucial game against ZPC Kariba tomorrow.The veteran administrator said he visited the players at their training ground.CAPS have good chance of breaking an 11-year-old jinx in the title campaign as they are currently sitting second on the log standings just a point behind leaders FC Platinum with seven games remaining in the season.The club fears the disturbances could rock their campaign, which had looked promising under Lloyd Chitembwe. A misunderstanding occurred before the match and it s something that we are still seized with. Everything is under control and the boys today (yesterday) were back at training and tomorrow morning (today) they will be travelling for the midweek match against ZPC Kariba, said Chitima.Makepekepe s elimination meant that their bid for a league and couple double have been dashed as they now have to invest all their energies in the Castle Lager Championship.But there was something to smile about for FC Platinum s Norman Mapeza after his side made it to the last eight to keep alive dreams of a successful season.The platinum miners overcame Chapungu 2-0 in a Midlands Derby courtesy of goals from Winston Mhango and Charles Sibanda, who finally broke the duck since his return to Zvishavane during the mid-season transfer window. I applaud my players for working hard and I will not single any one of them, but the whole team played so well. Charles finally scored and it s his job to do so. He was never under any pressure for we knew he would score. We now wait for the quarter-final draw and just to be clear, please note we are not chasing a double because we are not yet in the Chibuku final, said Mapeza.FC Platinum were joined in the last eight by Tsholotsho, Highlanders, ZPC Kariba, Triangle, Harare City, newboys Ngezi Platinum and How Mine.
