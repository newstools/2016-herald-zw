MONCHENGLADBACH. Borussia Monchengladbach coach Andre Schubert says his side have nothing to fear against a Barcelona team shorn of the injured Lionel Messi for tonight s Champions League soccer clash. Barcelona opened their assault on Europe a fortnight ago with a 7-0 drubbing of Celtic at the Camp Nou while the Germans suffered a 4-0 defeat at Pep Guardiola s Manchester City. But Schubert, whose contract has been extended until 2019, insists his side need not be intimidated. There is no reason to be awestruck. We will approach the game with energy, joy and a willingness to fight, Schubert told a press conference yesterday. Schubert s new deal, announced yesterday, is recognition for steering Gladbach from bottom of the Bundesliga when he took over in September 2015 to Champions League qualification by finishing fourth.The show of faith in the 45-year-old coach is a timely boost ahead of the visit of Luis Enrique s Barcelona, who are without groin-injury victim Messi. We d liked to have seen Lionel Messi at Borussia Park, said Schubert. We always like to play against very, very good teams, but the best player in the world will be missing. AFP.
