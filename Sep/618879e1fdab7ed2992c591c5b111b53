Philani NcubeSports Reporter MASVINGO referee Jimmy Makwanda was the only casualty at yesterday s physical fitness test for elite match officials when he failed to do the repeated sprint ability under the expected time. This means the stocky referee has immediately been suspended from handling top-flight matches.He can only be reinstated after he has passed a retest which he can only take after a recommended recovery time of six weeks from the first test.Makwanda could not manage to do the repeated sprint ability, performing sprints of a distance of 40 meters under six seconds.Another referee Adam Mutenha did not undergo the examination as he is carrying an injury and will also be sidelined until he is fit to do the test.Forty-six top-flight referees completed and passed the examination.The assistant referees were subjected to a third test which specifically deals with their line of officiating called change of direction ability test.The fitness test was conducted by FIFA accredited physical fitness test instructors, NUST lecturer Morris Banda and former FIFA and CAF panel referee Alfred Zindove, and is being used by the ZIFA Referees Committee to determine which referees will represent the country on the 2017 FIFA panel.The Referees Committee is expected to meet tomorrow to come up with a comprehensive list of 17 referees for both centre and assistant referees they will recommend to FIFA for 2017 assignments.Zimbabwe have been allocated 17 slots by the FIFA Referees Committee for next season.They had the same number of referees on the FIFA panel this year.Norman Matemera, Philani Ncube and Nomore Musundirehave been on the FIFA panel handling international matches.Also on the panel are six assistant referees Edgar Rumeck, Luckson Mhara, Salani Ncube, Brighton Nyika, Thomas Kusosa and Wirimai Muroyiwa.The trio of Kuda Majo, Thanks Nyahume and Tambudzai Tawengwa and assistants Stella Ruvinga, Claris Simango and Faith Mloyi made up the female referees FIFA Panel.Two slots are reserved for Futsal match officials.After the fitness test, ZIFA Referees Committee treasurer Japhet Mufiri urged the match officials to handle the remaining PSL matches to the best of their ability. Let me take this opportunity to thank you for the games you have been handling. You have been in the limelight, but the Committee is noticing a downward trend in complaints. We are now in the final stretch of PSL and ZIFA competitions, the pressure is increasing, but we don t expect referees to be pressured in any way. We expect you to perform to the best of your ability and make sure whatever you do is free of controversy. Those who have been on the FIFA panel must also accept that at the end of the season they cease to be on the panel. All of you have been applying through this test and the good thing is we didn t have many casualties though in future we expect to have a hundred percent pass rate, said Mufiri.Elite Referees:Female: Thanks Nyahuye, Stella Ruvinga, Faith Mloyi, Tambudzai Tawengwa, Saneliso Sibanda, Sibonukhuhle Sibanda, Claris Simango, Kuda Majo, Nyarai Chirwa.Male: Norman Matemera, Ruzie Ruzive, Nomore Musundire, Tapfumaneyi Mutengwa, Josiah Masimira, Pedzisai Chadya, Luckson Mhara, Victor Kambadzo, Chenai Ndoro, Asthma Mataya, Collen Muringayi, Chenjerai Chihumbiri, Bongani Gadzikwa, Wellington Mazambani, Alois Muzorori, Lawrence Zimondi, Brighton Nyika, Philani Ncube, Salani Ncube, Tembinkosi Sibanda, Allen Basvi, Peter Simutenda, Hardley Ndazi, Brilliant Sibanda, Oscah Bumhe, Melody Ncube, Arnold Ncube, Brighton Chimene, Antony Siyavhunda, Bernard Matenga, Thomas Masaa, Thomas Kusosa, Edgar Rumeck, Virimai Muroiwa, Thabani Bamala, Munyaradzi Majoni, Allen Parehwa.
