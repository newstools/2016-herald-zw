MADRID. Substitute Sergio Araujo struck a late equaliser as Las Palmas held Real Madrid to a 2-2 draw and left them with a one-point lead over Barcelona at the top of the Spanish La Liga soccer table on Saturday. Karim Benzema had given Real a 2-1 lead in the 67th, three minutes after coming on, but the hosts spoiled the visitors night with Araujo s 85th minute goal. Barca, playing without the injured Lionel Messi for the first time this season, won 5-0 at 10-man Sporting Gijon earlier in the day. Neymar scored twice while Luis Suarez, Arda Turan and Rafinha also hit the back of the net. I m disappointed with the two goals we gave away, Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane said. We had the game under control but we had a lack of concentration at the end. We deserved to win this game. Real, who saw their record-equalling 16-game winning run in La Liga halted in Wednesday s 1-1 draw with Villarreal, took a deserved 33rd-minute lead. Reuters.
