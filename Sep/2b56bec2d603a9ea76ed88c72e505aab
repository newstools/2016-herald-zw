Mobile telecommunication operator, Telecel yesterday said it is expanding its 3rd Generation (3G) network with 44 new sites already set up, while a further 74 will be rolled out by year-end. In a statement, Telecel chief technology and innovation officer, Mr Tendayi Chirokote said by year-end, a total of 337 3G sites would have been either improved or rolled out. Telecel has also expanded its 3G network with 44 new 3G sites in its network upgrade project which the mobile company says is an on-going exercise. The mobile operator is aiming to complete a total of 74 new 3G sites before end of this year, leading to a total of 337 3G sites either improved or newly rolled out, he said.Earlier in the year, Telecel upgraded 203 3G sites mainly in urban areas to provide even faster 3G internet speed in these areas while another 60 sites will be upgraded by the end of this year.Mr Chirokote said the mobile company was concentrating particularly on areas that have previously not enjoyed 3G data coverage or have had inadequate coverage. The current mobile data upgrade exercise is primarily targeting rural and peri-urban areas were our data coverage has been lagging behind with many of those sites being 2G sites. The exercise will see many of our 2G sites being upgraded to 3G. In addition to upgrading the current 2G sites to 3G status the current exercise is also ensuring internet speeds on our network are being increased in urban areas. The most notable increases in mobile internet speeds have been recorded in Bulawayo, Northern Harare, Mutare, Bindura, Chinhoyi, Kariba and Rusape, said Chirokote.Among some of the rural and peri-urban areas that have benefited from the new 3G sites are Filabusi, Binga, Nkayi, Mvurwi, How Mine, Gwanda, Guruve, Mutoko, Nyamapanda, Chivhu, Gokwe, Rafingora and Lion s Den.While Telecel is still upgrading to 3G data network, its peers Econet and Netone are now using 4th Generation (4G) also known as LTE (Long Term Evolution), a much higher grade for data users.
