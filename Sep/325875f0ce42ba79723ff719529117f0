WELLINGTON. Super Rugby will retain its much-criticised conference format next year, while tweaking kick-off times to trial tomorrow night matches and increase the number of afternoon games. Governing body SANZAAR introduced conferences in 2016 to allow Super Rugby s expansion to 18 teams, including Japan s Sunwolves, Argentina s Jaguares and South Africa s Southern Kings. But the expanded competition which straddles 16 time zones and four continents resulted in complaints of lopsided contests, exhausting travel schedules and a fragmented four conference system seen as too complex.In addition, the new teams struggled, particularly the Sunwolves, who managed just one win from 15 matches.
