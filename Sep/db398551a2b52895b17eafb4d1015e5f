Prosper Dembedza : Court CorrespondentSIX MDC-T supporters who stoned police officers who sought to stop them from assaulting people who were pegging stands at Miriandi Farm in Ruwa were last Friday freed on $50 bail each. Victor Chaza (36), Chamisa Maregera (42), Daniel Muchadekurwa (21), Tapiwa Machisa (39), Ugo Mushwa and Richard Mapinge (33) were facing public violence charges when they appeared before Harare magistrate Mrs Vongai Muchuchuti. As part of their bail conditions, the six were ordered to report once every Friday to CID Law and Order and to continue residing at their given addresses.On September 14, 2016, at around 1pm, the six accused persons went to Subdivision 3 of Miriandi Farm in Ruwa where they removed some pegs and assaulted people who were pegging stands at the farm.The court heard that the farm is currently being subdivided into residential stands, a process which has caused misunderstanding among people who are involved in the subdivision of the stands and beneficiaries.The court heard that police were summoned and upon arrival at the scene, they tried to control the accused persons who became even more violent and started assaulting them.It is alleged that the accused persons started throwing stones at the police prompting them to call for reinforcement before they managed to arrest the six, while their accomplices fled.Mr Douglas Mwonzora is representing the six.
