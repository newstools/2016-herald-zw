We were running out of time but we are now trooping into camp right now and we will have our first training in the afternoon, he said. Most of the players we have called up are coming in and we expect everyone to be here after Saturday. There will not be any changes to the 35 players we announced unless something happens but so far we are expecting only those players. There will be some Premier League games tomorrow (today) and Saturday and we allowed those from Harare City, Triangle and CAPS United, among other clubs, to fulfil their fixtures first.
