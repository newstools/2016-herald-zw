Tawanda Matanhire Cool Lifestyle Reporter &#8212;-Schools in the country have a culture of selecting exceptional pupils to lead and guide others basing on different criteria within the system.These pupils operate in different capacities either as class monitors, prefects and head boys or head girls, making sure the school is a better place for everyone. Many of these assume these positions with little or no knowledge on how to operate and therefore need professional training on leadership roles.For this cause Zoe Counselling and Training Centre Trust was established at the beginning of this year to groom school prefects.This is an organisation involved in prefects training and guidance and counselling sessions. In July the organisation held prefects leadership training for Zimre primary school within the school premises where a number of topics including duties and roles of prefects, communication skills, team building, assertiveness and grooming and deportment were taught.This was an opportunity for prefects to interact with the staff members and break down barriers between the two parties.Zimre primary school head boy Courage Sithole said the training helped him fight off fear and lack of confidence. This training helped me so much as an individual to fight off fear and lack of confidence. As a body of prefects we are now going to work as a team he said.He went on to say that he was now confident enough to execute his duties unlike in the past. Some of the schools the organisation has trained include Ruvheneko, Thorncroft, Goromonzi Committee and Green Olive primary schools.They recently held a Tug of Life presentation to pupils from Grade One up to Grade Six at Wise Owl group of schools. Tug of Life programme helps young people to define their goals and to be their best in all dimensions of their lives. It helps young people identify their challenges, choices, consequences and desired outcomes and be able to develop an effective game plan for life.During the presentations, a tug of war scenario was executed between girls and boys with girls representing peer pressure, drug and substance abuse, bullying, stealing and crime, to mention a few.The boys won the tug of war and it was explained that this is what happens in our real life situations whereby bad influences try to tug pupils away from their goals.Young people have to stand their ground and also need other good people who influence them to have partners that can assist them to win in life.One of the pupils Tatenda Nyakuno said he felt empowered to be able to make informed decisions. I feel so empowered to be able to make informed decisions that will enable me to achieve my goals because I want to become a medical doctor, Nyakuno said.
