Paidamoyo Chipunza Senior Health ReporterThe Radiation Protection Authority of Zimbabwe (RPAZ) has finally approved the use of radiotherapy machines worth millions of dollars at Harare Central Hospital, becoming the first hospital in the country to use the new machines which were bought by Government under a US$100 million loan facility extended by the China Exim Bank.The equipment, which includes a magnetic resonance imaging machine, computerised tomograph (CT scan) and two X-ray machines were imported into the country four years ago and have not been in use.Harare Hospital s clinical director Mr George Vera said approval to use the machines came in about a month ago. We now have our approvals, which came in about four weeks ago and the machines are now in use, said Mr Vera.Mr Vera said the machines will go a long way in making health care accessible and affordable to majority of Zimbabweans, some of whom have been paying huge amounts at private institutions to undergo associated medical investigations.Private institutions charge between US$500 and US$1 500 for a CT scan whereas the same is about US$200 at Government facilities.An MRI and X-ray scan cost as much as US$700 and US$200 respectively at private facilities while State-run entities charge no more than US$200 and US$20. These machines will definitely reduce costs of medical investigations required on patients thereby increasing accessibility to health care services particularly on the poor Zimbabweans who cannot afford costs at private institutions, said Mr Vera.RPAZ chief executive Mr Reward Severa also confirmed the latest development saying the hospital has now complied with the law.Mpilo Central Hospital, which has been in the same predicament with Harare Hospital also said it was working on its papers to ensure its equipment is operational by next month.The hospital s acting chief executive, Mr Lovemore Mabandi said all modalities were put in place, adding that they are just waiting for the regulatory authority to issue an operating licence.According to the Radiation Protection Act 14 (a) reads, no person or individual are allowed to conduct any radiation practice without a licence.However, Harare Central Hospital and Mpilo Hospitals had not sought these approvals from the regulatory authorities resulting in the equipment lying idle over the years.According to RPAZ, radiology is restricted because of its potential harm to people s health.
