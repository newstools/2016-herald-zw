Sports ReporterWEST Indie are expected to arrive in Harare this afternoon to take part in the cricket Triangular Series featuring hosts Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka. The Windies arrive without some of their big names like Chris Gayle, Marlon Samuels, wicketkeeper Denesh Ramdin and allrounder Kieron Pollard but they have a strong outfit led by Jason Holder.The tri-series will get underway on Monday when host Zimbabwe engage Sri Lanka while the West Indies open their campaign against Sri Lanka two days later.The final will be played in Bulawayo on November 27.Zimbabwe yesterday named their squad which included Tinashe Panyangara who has returned from a recurring back injury.Panyangara had been overlooked for the previous ODI series against India in June because of the injury. But there was no joy for fellow seamer Tendai Chatara who remains in the sidelines.The hosts have also retained Chris Mpofu to beef up the attack while Carl Mumba, who made his Test debut in the recent two-match series, also got a place after impressing with the ball.Mumba, together with fellow Mid West Rhinos rising star Tarisai Musakanda will be looking for their first ODI caps during the triangular series.Peter Moor will keep wicket while Elton Chigumbura and Chamu Chibhabha who were not considered for Tests have been called for the ODIs.Zimbabwe will be looking to atone for their losses in the last two Test matches against Sri Lanka.West Indies also have some points to score coming from a disappointing tour of the United Arab Emirates where they lost to Pakistan across all three formats.However, wicketkeeper Shane Dowrich who was a late inclusion in the 15-man squad after veteran batsman Marlon Samuels pulled out, was upbeat ahead of the Zimbabwe tour.Dowrich, who has featured in the Windies Test side in eight matches, is looking forward to his first-ever 50-overs series and believes his transition to the one-day format will not be a challenge.Dowrich has been impressive in his eight Tests to date since making his debut last year and told the West Indies Cricket Board website that he was thrilled by the prospect of one-day cricket. I m excited about the one-day tour, it s a new chapter for me. I haven t really played a lot of one-day cricket but I think it is something to look forward and it is something I am very interested in as well. For me, one day cricket is about being smart. You have to look to bat 50 overs but you still have to be positive in your intent and I m a positive person so I don t think it will be a big transition for me but just being selective and being able to pick gaps and that sort of stuff [will be important], he said. In terms of the keeping, [I have to be] a little more explosive and mobile in terms of movement. That s all I have to really work on going into the one-day series. Dowrich made headlines recently as West Indies stunned Pakistan to win the third and final Test in Sharjah by five wickets.Zim Squad:Graeme Cremer (capt), Hamilton Masakadza, Tarisai Musakanda, Malcolm Waller, Chamu Chibhabha, Peter Moor (wk), Elton Chigumbura, Sean Williams, Craig Ervine, Sikandar Raza, Donald Tiripano, Tendai Chisoro, Brian Chari, Carl Mumba, Christopher Mpofu, Tinashe Panyangara.West Indies Squad:Sulieman Benn, Carlos Brathwaite, Kraigg Brathwaite, Darren Bravo, Jonathan Carter, Johnson Charles, Miguel Cummins, Shane Dowrich, Shannon Gabriel, Jason Holder (Captain), Shai Hope, Evin Lewis, Sunil Narine, Ashley Nurse and Rovman Powell.
