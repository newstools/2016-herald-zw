DjokovicLONDON. Novak Djokovic is ready to fight for his world number one status as Andy Murray heads into this week s Paris Masters tennis tournament looking to overtake the Serb. Briton Murray (29) won his third title in as many weeks with victory in Vienna on Sunday, and could top the rankings with another good run in Paris.Four-time champion Djokovic says he is rejuvenated after a slump in form. It makes me want to go on court and fight for every point because there is something to win at the end, he said.The 12-time Grand Slam champion returns to action after losing in the Shanghai semi-finals two weeks ago.Djokovic (29) has finished four of the past five years as the world number one and will hold on to the top ranking if he reaches the final in Paris.However, failure to do so would allow Murray to overtake him if the Scot can win, or if Murray reaches the final and Djokovic falls before the semis.
