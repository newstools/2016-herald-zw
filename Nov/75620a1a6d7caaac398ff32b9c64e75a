Prince HarryLONDON. Britain s Prince Harry confirmed yesterday he is dating US actress Meghan Markle as he blasted the racist wave of abuse and harassment directed towards her since their relationship came to light. In what Kensington Palace admitted was an unusual statement, the prince (32) urged media to refrain from further damage as he hit out at the racial undertones of newspaper coverage.Harry also took issue with the outright racism and sexism on social media directed against mixed-race Californian television actress Markle (35) best known for her role as Rachel Zane in the US TV drama Suits . The past week has seen a line crossed, said the statement from Harry s communications secretary Jason Knauf. His girlfriend, Meghan Markle, has been subject to a wave of abuse and harassment. Prince Harry is worried about Ms Markle s safety and is deeply disappointed that he has not been able to protect her. It is not right that a few months into a relationship with him that Ms Markle should be subjected to such a storm. He knows commentators will say this is the price she has to pay and that this is all part of the game . He strongly disagrees. This is not a game it is her life and his. Markle s mother is black and her father is white.A grandson of Queen Elizabeth II, Harry is fifth in line to the throne behind his father Prince Charles, brother Prince William, and William s children Prince George and Princess Charlotte.
