Fredrick Mandizvidza. . . to apply for refusal of further remandTendai Rupapa Senior Court Reporter&#8212;Zimbabwe Manpower Development Fund (Zimdef) chief executive Fredrick Mandizvidza, accused of fraud and abuse of office yesterday notified the court for the second time that he would apply for refusal of further remand on the next court date if he is not furnished with his trial date. On the previous court appearance, prosecutor Mr Sebastian Mutizirwa, told the court that investigations into the matter were complete and the docket was sent to the National Prosecuting Authority for perusal.However, the State could not furnish him with a trial date yesterday after they requested for more time saying they needed to consolidate the record with those of his principal director (finance), Nicholas Mapute and Higher and Tertiary Education, Science and Technology Development Deputy Minister Godfrey Gandawa who are facing similar charges.Prosecuting, Mr Peter Kachirika applied for postponement of the case to November 30 to allow the State to combine the said records for purposes of trial.However, Mandizvidza s lawyer Mr Pisirai Kwenda consented to the postponement on condition that the State provides them with a trial date on November 30.Should the State fail to provide him with a trial date, Mandizvidza will mount an application for refusal of further remand.Magistrate Mrs Vongai Muchuchuti-Guwuriro remanded the matter to November 30.Zimdef is a State enterprise in the Ministry of Higher and Tertiary Education, Science and Technology Development whose responsibility is to mobilise money from industry to fund manpower development.It is alleged that on November 11 last year, Mandizvidza connived with a ministry official and allegedly created a fake document purporting that the trustee of the fund, Higher and Tertiary Education Minister Professor Jonathan Moyo, had authorised and approved the purchase of 10 heavy-duty printers worth $95 800.The court heard that no such authorisation was granted.It is alleged Mandizvidza released the money to Wisebone Trading s CABS account number, although the company deals in agro-chemical and engineering services.The court heard that Mandizvidza knew that the company was not into information technologies.No printers were supplied.It is also alleged that while Zimdef has no provisions for personal loans, Mandizvidza and his accomplices processed a loan of $24 000 on October 19 last year.Zimdef lost $119 800 and nothing was recovered.
