Paul Mundandi Sports Reporter NGEZI Platinum skipper Liberty Chakoroma has taunted CAPS United ahead of their showdown at the National Sports Stadium tomorrow.Chakoroma scored twice in his last two matches even though he is a defensive player. I think clubs in Zimbabwe must respect us because we are a better team. They must accord us enough respect and against CAPS United we are going to fight until the final whistle, he said. There is going to be Fair Play from a team called Ngezi and we are not afraid of Makepekepe. Hatisi kudzora tsvimbo and we are working very hard because we want to spoil their party. If they are going to be the champions of Zimbabwe they have to fight for it, but the truth is we want a win. We want to be the first team to beat CAPS United at their fortress. We have the material and after winning the Chibuku Super Cup we want to maintain our winning streak and finish in the top eight. They must feel that we are CAF (inter-club) material on Sunday afternoon and we are not in the tournament to add numbers, but to fly the Zimbabwe flag high. Chakoroma joined Ngezi at the beginning of the season when he was signed by Clifton Kadurira.He was the top goalscorer in the Chibuku Super Cup after scoring four times.He also had a short stint in South Africa at Free State Stars where he lasted six months before packing his bags in frustration .The 22-year-old has become the darling of Ngezi and many neutrals.Ngezi Platinum coach Tonderai Ndiraya is promising fireworks. It s going to be a very exciting match and we are going to be very competitive despite playing away from home. We know they have Tsipa, (Leonard) but they must know that we also have a good defence that did well in the Chibuku Super Cup and they are going to find it very competitive on Sunday I am urging fans to come in their numbers to witness a good match. We are mentally and physically prepared for the tie and we are even motivated.
