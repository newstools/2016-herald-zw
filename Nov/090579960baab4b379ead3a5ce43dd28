LONDON. Chelsea manager, Antonia Conte says Victor Moses is a good player who deserves his moment in the spotlight.

Conte was quizzed by ITV about Moses great run of form and the Italian did not hold back in his words of adulation for the Super Eagles man. Victor is a good player. I saw him during the pre-season and I wanted to keep him in the squad. It is the same with Pedro, he (Moses) deserves to play. And he is playing some fantastic football for us. He is very important for us, Conte said shortly after Chelsea s 2-1 victory over Spurs.Moses who scooped his second consecutive man-of-the-match award was also pressed to discuss his new-found form and match-winning performance against Spurs. The winger said he was happy with his goal at Stamford Bridge but was even more ecstatic with the win which catapulted Chelsea back to the top of the league standings. I am very pleased with the goal but the most important thing is the three points that we got (on Saturday). I thought they (Spurs) started very well and the goal they scored was a beautiful goal. There was nothing we could have done about that. But Pedro got us a beautiful goal and we got ourselves back into the game. As I said, the three points was the most important thing and we are very pleased to have gotten it.Moses is currently enjoying the best moment of his career after spending the last three years on loan away from Stamford Bridge.The 25-year-old is feeling at home in his current surroundings. Yeah, I have definitely found a home at Chelsea. It is my club and I am pleased to be playing this season. AFP.
