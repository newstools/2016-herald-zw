LONDON. Arsenal star Mesut Ozil is reportedly close to agreeing to sign a new contract at the Emirates Stadium after months of talks.The Germany international is a vital part of Arsene Wenger s side, and is said to be edging closer to putting pen to paper on a new 160 000 per week deal. Ozil (28) has long been regarded as one of the best attacking midfielders in the world, and has finally started to repay that 42 million that Arsenal invested to bring him in from Real Madrid in 2013.According to the Daily Mirror, Arsenal will now be handed the timely boost of Ozil committing his future to the club with a contract running for another five years.This would theoretically keep the playmaker in north London until the age of 33, ensuring he spends his peak years in a red and white shirt.Meanwhile, Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has conceded that Ozil used to be lazy, but isn t any more.Having initially been slow to get going when he moved to Arsenal in 2014, the former Real Madrid man attracted plenty of criticism for not putting in the hard yards on the pitch.However, Ozil has notched seven goals in all competitions so far this season and Wenger believes there has been a change in the Germany international. He pushes himself much more. He has that in him as well, said Wenger. Sometimes the trap for very talented players is that it is easy for them.They know subconsciously they don t need to push themselves too hard to be efficient. Metro.
