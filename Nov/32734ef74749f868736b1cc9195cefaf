This is going to be one of the toughest games of the season, said Madhombi. They are chasing the championship and we don t have much to play for but we are professionals and we will give them a good run. They always give us a good game and I don t think there will be much difference but they will be under pressure. We have been in good form of late and I don t think that will change. The first game, which we drew 0-0, was an opening encounter and the teams had not settled but now we know that striker Malvin Dumbura has been scoring for fun having gone for six games finding the back of the net, Phillip Makumi has been brilliant between the sticks.Meanwhile, Black Rhinos goalkeeper Herbert Rusawo is happy to be part of ZIFA Northern Region top eleven players who were selected on Saturday.
