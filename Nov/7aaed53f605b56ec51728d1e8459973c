This is expected to cut costs for patients who had been seeking medical attention from countries such as India and South Africa.Chitungwiza Central Hospital chief executive Dr Obadiah Moyo said this last Friday at a graduation ceremony of 100 registered general nurses and 100 midwives at the institution. The Ministry of Health and Child Care chose our hospital to be the country s national centre for kidney transplant. We are going to open the Sally Mugabe Kidney Transplantation Unit to assist patients with chronic kidney disease, he said.Dr Moyo said localising the kidney transplantation would bring a relief to patients who had been going overseas for treatment.Officiating at the same event, RioZim chief executive Mr Bhekinkosi Nkomo said that a number of companies had assisted with resources towards the establishment of the transplantation unit. I have also learnt that several corporate organisations and conglomerates such as MIMOSA and ZIMPLATS have assisted the hospital in a number of ways including sponsoring the establishment of the transplantation unit, which will give more life to people currently relying on dialysis, My company, through its foundation, will consider possibilities in which it can best participate in the development of this institution as we believe it is a worthy cause that deserves to be supported in one way or another, said Mr Nkomo.An estimated 1 000 patients with kidney failure are diagnosed every year in Zimbabwe.
