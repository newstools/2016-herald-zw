Farmers should also join the Village Anti-Stock Theft Committees, and other committees working hand in hand with the police to be able to advance their grievances to the relevant authorities to find lasting solutions to their grievances, he said.Snr Asst Comm Makodza also urged the business community to partner the farmers and the police by joining the Business Against Stock Theft Forum to protect the national herd.Meanwhile, police have launched a manhunt for seven suspects believed to be behind a spate of stock theft activities countrywide.These are Felix Nyamuranga of Masvingo, Spencer Mudzinganyama and Toziwei Karimazondo all of Mutoko, Amon Nyathi, Vusimuzi Mafu, Prince Vusa and Nkosilathi Moyo all of Gwanda.Anyone with information leading to their arrests should contact any nearest police station.
