Arts Reporter &#8212; United Kingdom-based upcoming gospel artiste Lewis Ngara is making waves with his latest single titled Ndisiye Ndisiye . The single has been well received on both the local and international scene. In an interview with The Herald, Ngara said he never thought that his song would be a hit. It is one of my best songs and I never thought it would be appreciated. My music has suddenly gone viral. I am receiving a lot of phone calls and text messages from fans telling me that my music is good. Ndisiye Ndisiye is getting more air time because people are demanding it, he said.Ngara, who is a teacher by profession, said he started singing at a tender age and has never looked back. I used to cry a lot when I was a baby. Elders then predicted that I was going to be a musician. I started singing at Sunday school, school and church choirs. I got a chance to learn music theory at Nyadire Teachers College in Mtoko and with that knowledge I recorded my first album in 2005, he said.Apart from Ndisiye Ndisiye , Ngara has two albums in his name, Jesus is calling in 2013 and Love Jesus produced in 2016.Ngara, a devout Christian, owes his success to God. His music includes wordship, praise and thanks giving. However, he is finding it difficult to assemble a live band due to related costs. It is very difficult to organise people especially in a band when you are starting out. Ngara said his music career, which had suffered from other commitments such as school, is headed for a boom. It was a bit challenging for me to concentrate on music when I was studying full time. Now that studying is over, all my attention is on music, he said.&nbsp;
