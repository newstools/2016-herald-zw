TrumpWASHINGTON. Donald Trump is going with a former critic for a key foreign policy post, picking South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley to be US ambassador to the United Nations. Governor Haley has a proven track record of bringing people together regardless of background or party affiliation to move critical policies forward for the betterment of her state and our country, Trump said in announcing the nomination. She is also a proven deal-maker, and we look to be making plenty of deals. She will be a great leader representing us on the world stage. Haley (44), who won election to the governor s post as part of the Tea Party wave in 2010, criticised Trump throughout the Republican nomination campaign and endorsed Florida Sen. Marco Rubio during the South Carolina primary.After Rubio dropped out, Haley backed Trump opponent Ted Cruz.Haley &#8211; who must be confirmed by the Senate &#8211; said she was honoured by Trump s selection of her as UN ambassador. Our country faces enormous challenges here at home and internationally, she said in a statement put out by the Trump transition team.Earlier this year, Haley called Trump one of the angriest voices in politics and criticised his irresponsible talk, including the candidate s call to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States.Trump returned the favour during the divisive GOP campaign, tweeting on March 1: The people of South Carolina are embarrassed by Nikki Haley! As UN ambassador, Haley would be given Cabinet rank, officials said. &#8211; USA Today.
