Blessing Malinganiza Herald Reporter&#8212; Government on Wednesday launched a special programme aimed at eliminating mother-to-child transmission of both HIV and congenital syphilis. Speaking at Dzivaresekwa Stadium in Harare during the launch of the programme dubbed: Start Free Stay Free Aids Free Framework , the Minister of Health and Child Care Dr David Parirenyatwa said Government was emphasising on the need for every child to be born HIV free. Zimbabwe has embraced the regional agenda of reaching the dual elimination of mother-to-child transmission of both HIV and congenital syphilis and as such, there is need to increase testing of pregnant women for syphilis and to adequately treat at least 95 percent of women who test syphilis positive, said Dr Parirenyatwa. By embracing the component on Start Free, I am emphasising that every child should be born HIV-free and remain so, and all HIV positive pregnant women should have access to lifelong anti-retroviral treatment. For the country to achieve this, it requires that pregnant women book their pregnancies early and that they access testing and treatment early if they test HIV positive. Dr Parirenyatwa said HIV prevention remained key to stemming the tide of new HIV infections and achieving results towards ending Aids by 2030, adding that there was urgent need to close the gap on new infections.The Minister of State for Harare Provincial Affairs Miriam Chikukwa said according to the Government s economic blueprint Zim-Asset, some measure of progress was achieved on the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 6 on combating HIV and Aids. However, our health delivery system continues to be adversely affected by the shortage of funds to procure essential drugs and medical equipment. It is therefore essential for all of us to come up with alternative preventive measures to combat epidemics such as HIV and in this regard, we have to scale up prevention of HIV infection amongst adolescents and young women, said Minister Chikukwa.
