Titled Punha , the album contains seven tracks namely Kobiri , Hwahwa , Punha , Dzoka , Mubaiwa , Rufu and an instrumental for Dzoka .He revealed that his latest offering was about the journey of a poor man who became successful owing to his hard working habits and was a surprise to many people. Punha is a Shona word which refers to someone who is looked down on in society and has no material riches to show.He encouraged people to support one another and never to look down on disadvantaged people in society. On this project Kendyman worked with a full band fusing mbira and other musical instrument to bring out a rich African traditional and jazz sound. I really wanted to give fans a different sound from what s in the market and hopefully they will love my work, he said. A businessman who is into animal health and farming, Kendyman also has a National Certificate in Music from a local college.
