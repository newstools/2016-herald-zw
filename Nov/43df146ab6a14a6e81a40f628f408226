Arts Reporter &#8212; In preparation for their joint show at Harare International Conference Centre on December 2, Jah Prayzah is learning some of Diamond Platnumz s song so that their combination on stage will not be confined to the duet Watora Mari . Jah Prayzah recently posted a video clip his Facebook page on which he mimics Diamond Platnumz s Number One and his manger Keen Mushapaidze said the musicians are exchanging notes via social media in order to make their show memorable.He said the two musicians will likely pull surprises on stage beyond the Watora Mari collaboration. They have been communicating about the show and they are planning to do exciting things on the day. We will have rehearsals with Diamond Platnumz when he arrives for the show to perfect the act. We are all excited because it would be our first show after Watora Mari and its exciting video that has been successful regionally, said Mushapaidze.He said they will be bringing some people that took part on the Watora Mari video from South Africa to the show. The participants includes the lady who features prominently as a vixen on the video.The upcoming gig has been aptly dubbed Watora Mari Concert after the duet and organisers, 2Kings Entertainment, said everything is going according to plan.Dee Nosh of 2King Entertainment said the current preparations were merely final touches since the better part of groundwork was done last month when the show was initially scheduled to take place. After changing the date to December 2, we are simply doing a few things in relation to the alteration because most things were already covered in October. We are certain the show will mark the beginning of interesting December festivities ahead of the festive season, said Dee Nosh. Both camps are looking forward to a historic concert. It could be the beginning of bigger things in their stage collaborations, so they are treating the concert as a special occasion.
