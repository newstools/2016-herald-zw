We have just received six more women from Kuwait. The seventh one was left behind because her documents were not in order and Kuwait authorities were investigating her, he said.The women are expected to help with investigations into the human trafficking saga.Cde Paradza said from discussions by the women, 30 seem to be stuck in Kuwait.He said Government was making frantic efforts to ensure that they were re-united with their families back home. What the Government has done so far is that it has set up a team made up of social welfare officers and investigators from police to go to Kuwait and engage authorities there so that they can locate all those who are still outstanding, he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
