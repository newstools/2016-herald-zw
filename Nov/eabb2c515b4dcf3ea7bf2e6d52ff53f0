SHARJAH. Skipper Jason Holder took a maiden five-wicket haul and opener Kraigg Brathwaite stood firm in a tense chase to take West Indies to the brink of a consolation win in the third and final Test cricket against Pakistan in Sharjah yesterday. Holder set his team without a win in their past 13 Tests on the path to victory with a career-best 5-30 to dismantle Pakistan for 208, which gave the West Indies a target of 153 in 135 overs spread over four sessions.When bad light forced the players from the field nine overs early on the fourth and penultimate day, Brathwaite was unbeaten on 44 with the West Indies on 114-5, still needing 39 runs with five wickets intact.Brathwaite, who carried his bat in the first innings with 142, has added 47 runs for the sixth wicket with Shane Dowrich (36 not out) to lift West Indies from 67-5.Brathwaite, who survived a bat-pad catch review on 43, has hit four boundaries in another resolute 88-ball knock, frustrating Pakistan s bowling for a second time in the match.Pakistan coach Mickey Arthur said: It could still go either way . We are two wickets away from being favourites and this can happen in two balls, he added. We should have scored big in the first innings and a below-par score of 281 left us play chasing games. West Indies slumped alarmingly after a solid start. Leg-spinner Yasir Shah (3-30) dismissed Leon Johnson leg-before-wicket for 12, Darren Bravo was caught behind for three and Marlon Samuels was caught in the deep for 10.Paceman Wahab Riaz then had Jermaine Blackwood bowled for four with a sharp incoming delivery and Roston Chase caught by Mohammad Nawaz for two to bring Pakistan back into the game.It could have been worse for the West Indies had Pakistan not dropped two catches in the first three overs.
