October was Breast Cancer Awareness month and a worldwide annual campaign took place involving thousands of organisations.Tafadzwa Zimoyo Senior Lifestyle Writer &#8212; Traditionally, people exercise for health benefits. They walk, run and go for gym sessions in order to drop some kilos or just stay healthy. Achieving set targets through different training routines brings personal satisfaction. Rarely do individuals exercise for other people s health benefits. It sounds like a paradox, yet the reality of exercising for the benefit of participants and non-participants comes upon us this morning when Zimpapers hosts the Cancer Power Walk .It seems these days more and more people are enrolling for different exercising programmes.It has become as fashionable as it is also a sign of growing understanding of the benefits of voluntary personal physical strain.And Zimpapers has invited people from all walks of life to come and have a little strain in a five-kilometre walk that will now start and end at Old Hararians Sports Club and not as previously advertised.Besides the additional benefits of the walk like free zumba sessions, breast cancer screening and sugar testing, the walk s major aim is to raise awareness on cancer and raise funds that will assist cancer patients.Some of the partners working with Zimpapers include Island Hospice, National AIDS Council, Tinga Mira, Beta Bricks, Eye Institute and Mars among othersSo, it now makes sense. You can exercise for health benefits of others while you also burn those unwanted calories in today s cancer walk.The Cancer Power Walk starts with registration at 5.30am before the actual walk at 6am.Musicians have expressed their willingness to partake in the healthy cause and the likes of Hope Masike, Sebastian Magacha and Ba Shupi will participate in the walk.According to Zimpapers group public relations and corporate affairs manager Beatrice Tonhodzayi there is going to be free cancer screening, BP checks and HIV testing at the site. This is to encourage a more holistic way of life which sees the public taking an interest in knowing their full health status. These will take place while a Zumba instructor will be taking people through the session. Participants will walk around using designated routes and go back to Old Hararians where other sessions will take place, she said.She said the walk is open to adults of all ages, race and creed. Cancer is affecting us. There is need to speak to people about it and make sure people know as much as they can about prevention. We are told that our lifestyle choices today pre-dispose us to some of these conditions, hence through this 5km walk we are saying let us come together to encourage each other to live healthier lives, she said.Some of the partners working with Zimpapers include Island Hospice, National AIDS Council, Tinga Mira, Beta Bricks, Eye Institute and Mars among others.This is a chance to contribute towards the fight against cancer and make someone smile through just walking for five kilometres.Just forget the rains, forget the heat and think for a good heart.Hope MasikeHow many things have you sacrificed for or done which are good so that at the end you do not only pat yourself on your chest, but also have great satisfaction and say This is good, I have done it for myself and for someone in need .The late Mahatma Gandhi once said, You may never know what results come out of your action. But if you do nothing there will be no result .October was Breast Cancer Awareness month and a worldwide annual campaign took place involving thousands of organisations, to highlight the importance of breast cancer awareness, education and research.And November is Men s Health Awareness Month , which means the opportunity to reach out to men and women in terms of health matters.In Zimbabwe, the campaigns come at a time when the Government has already called for an integrated HIV and cancer response upon realisation that there is need to seriously address the challenges posed by cancer.Well, besides the contribution to the cancer fight, the event could be a beginning point of exercising through regular walks for those that have not started the routine yet.Studies have revealed that daily walks help improve muscular strength in the body by keeping the muscles in regular use. The muscles which benefit the most are in the calves, glutens, hamstrings, legs and arms.Sarudzai Mukunganaya, a lifestyle coach, notes: Walking tones the muscles of the thighs, arms, forearms, behind and legs. The shapely legs of people who walk regularly are a result of their toned calves.Moreover, walking does not just build muscles but also helps in muscle endurance.This means that people who walk every morning can engage in physical exertion for a longer period of time without feeling tired. On Western note, earlier this year scores of Hollywood celebrities who include Rock Icon, Gene Simmons, Brad Garrett and stars from Dancing with the Stars, Chicago PD, Total Divas, UFC/MMA, Sex and the City and Major Crimes among others gathered to bet big at Tower Cancer Research Foundation s Cancer Free Generation Poker Tournament and Casino Night to raise awareness on the disease.So if your favourite celebrities are doing it , why not join in the fight?
