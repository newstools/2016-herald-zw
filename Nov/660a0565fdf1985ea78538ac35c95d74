Ekenia ChifambaLovemore Meya Lifestyle Correspondent&#8212; Spread love everywhere you go. Let no one ever come to you without leaving happier, goes the quote by the world s famous Mother Teresa known in the Catholic Church as Saint Teresa of Calcutta. She sowed a seed of love and caring during her lifetime and to date there are also quite a number of women who are fighting hard to bring a smile into someone s life.One such example is Ekenia Chifamba, director of Shamwari Yemwanasikana, a non-profit making organisation that has become a sanctuary for disadvantaged girls and a champion of their rights.And for her effort, Chifamba was nominated a Giraffe Hero for the Zimbabwe chapter recently.Giraffe Heroes Zimbabwe was launched in 2014 with the purpose of moving more and more citizens of the country to stick their necks out for the common good, and to give them tools to succeed.The organisation joins similar groups launched over the last four years in India, Nepal, Kenya, Sierra Leone, Singapore and Egypt.Although completely independent, all are inspired by the work of the Giraffe Heroes Project in the USA.In an interview, Chifamba could not hide her joy saying the nomination was meant to give her the strength to continue doing the good work. It is an honour to be nominated as a Giraffe Hero because it shows that my efforts to holistically empower and emancipate the girl child are being recognised, she said. The challenges I face in executing my duties include, but are not limited to, inadequate funding to expand programmes and attend to abuse cases continues to be a challenge as well as resistance and ignorance from community members. Another challenge is that of religious and traditional beliefs that are harmful towards the girl child as well as unfavourable economic conditionsthat affect corporate organisations commitment in assisting the organisation. She added that, Despite these challenges I will continue to work hard for the empowerment of the girl child. Terry Mutsvanga is the Chairperson of Giraffe Heroes Zimbabwe (GHZ) Chapter.Although the concept is still young, it has already honoured 30 Giraffe Heroes and it focuses on social and economic rights activists.The idea is to honour such individuals for standing up against injustice or doing something positive for the community, just like a Giraffe that keeps its neck high so is the Giraffe Hero.It strives to recognise unsung heroes who have positively contributed immensely in society and they hope to leave a legacy of positivity to future generations through their work.One such hero is Chifamba who has helped thousands of girls in need who are poor, victims of rape, need counselling, education or access to the justice system and escape from childhood marriages.Chifamba, in her quest to help the girls, faces constant hostility from traditionalists and some church elders who view her work as a threat to their traditional norms, which include shunning modern medicines and discouraging girls from going to go to school.Girls from traditional communities have been disciplined or threatened for attending her community meetings.Nevertheless, Chifamba insists on all girls right to a safe life, an education, and health care. My organisation sponsors clubs for more than 350 000 girls who get leadership skills, career guidance, and confidence building.They can take part in income-generating projects such as market gardening, basket weaving, and soap making. SYS programs offer victims of rape and abuse the help they need psychological and legal support, referrals to shelters, and transportation to police stations, courts, and hospitals, she said.Chifamba constantly lobbies communities and schools for eradication of practices that impede the girl child s full physical, emotional, spiritual growth and development.SYS has implemented the World Children s Programme in over 300 Zimbabwe schools and has partnered with Zimbabwe police for a campaign against sexual violence.Chifamba has led a training that creates community champions for ending child marriages and also launched a campaign to provide sanitary pads to disadvantaged girls in the country.Her work doesn t ignore the importance boys and men, and their attitudes and actions: SYS has established men and boys forums to educate males of all ages about protecting girls and ending child marriages.She is a results-driven leader deeply committed to a Zimbabwe where girls are free and able to stand up for their rights, with full support from the community.
