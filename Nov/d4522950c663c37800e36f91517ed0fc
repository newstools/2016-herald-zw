&nbsp;Continental body ups prize money Chiyangwa challenges warriors Philip ChiyangwaEddie Chikamhi Senior Sports Reporter ZIFA president Philip Chiyangwa has challenged the Warriors to up their game and reach for the top prize after the Confederation of African Football yesterday announced a massive increase in the financial rewards for the next two African Cup of Nations tournaments. The Warriors, who will be among 16 countries at the 2017 Nations Cup finals in Gabon, are set for rich pickings after it was revealed the next continental champions are set to pocket $4 million, which is more than double the previous $1.5 million winners cheque.CAF announced yesterday that they have improved prizes for all the tournaments they run starting next year.Earlier this year, CAF secured a lucrative deal with French oil giants Total who will become the official sponsor of African football for the next eight years after replacing French telecommunications group, Orange.Total will support CAF s 10 principal competitions, starting with the upcoming Nations Cup, which also has a global audience.A budget of $16.4 million has been set aside to go exclusively towards prize money for the 2017 AFCON tournament, up from $10m.The Warriors are already guaranteed $475 000 for just making it to the continental football showcase.The money has been allotted to teams that finish bottom of the group.But as a matter of principle, they will receive half the amount from CAF before the start of the tournament to enhance their preparations.CAF also revealed that those teams that go a step further and reach the quarter-finals will walk away $800 000 richer, up from $600 000 given to teams that reached the last eight in Gabon and Equatorial Guinea in 2015.Losing semi-finalists for the 2017 tourney will get $1.5 million, up from $750 000, while the prize for the tournament s silver medalists has also doubled to $2 million.Chiyangwa said the prize boost was a big incentive, which could only enhance the quality of the competition at the finals.Zimbabwe are in Group B where they face continental heavyweights Senegal, Algeria and Tunisia. We definitely welcome the improvements in terms of rewards and the prize monies for teams competing in the CAF tournaments. The more the rewards get better the more the quality of the game improves. Incentives are very crucial and I am sure with such a hefty increase everyone is happy. Imagine if Zimbabwe was to win AFCON? That US$4m is a lot of money which should take our football somewhere, besides changing the lives of some of these players forever. So we are saying this is a chance to you guys (the Warriors). The organisers have played their part, the money is there and it s now up to you whether you want the $4m or less. But what I know is we are not going to Gabon to make up the numbers. We have very good players who are able to compete. We have to finish on top, said Chiyangwa.Zimbabwe have begun preparations for the tournament and will face Tanzania in an international friendly at the National Sports Stadium this Sunday.The Warriors players called by coach Callisto Pasuwa this week were expected to start trooping in camp yesterday.The squad involves a cast of foreign based stars including talismanic forward Knowledge Musona, Marvelous Nakamba, Khama Billiat, Tino Kad ewere, Nyasha Mushekwi and skipper Willard Katsande.But key defender Costa Nhamoinesu will miss the match after his club questionably told ZIFA he was injured yet he has been playing for his club all along.Martizburg United defender Blessing Moyo was also reported injured by his new club but sources claimed last night that ZIFA may have been duped by the South African Premiership side.The sources said only striker Evans Rusike was genuinely injured having received a knock but the club seemed to have decided to hold onto to both their Zimbabwe internationals.Chiyangwa however, said the Warriors should not lose focus, while applauding CAF for availing incentives for teams participating in continental events.The financial boost also cascaded to all the 10 continental competitions played under the auspices of CAF.There was a substantial rise in the Champions League winners purse, which now stands at $2,5m up from the $1.5m recently won by Mamelodi Sundowns.The tournament will also be more inclusive as of next year after CAF made changes to its money spinning group stages which will now be competed for by 16 teams instead of the previous set up which had two groups of four.Clubs that reach the group stages will now be guaranteed $550 000 up from the previous allocation of $400 000.The Confederation Cup has also not been left behind as it will also have 16 teams participating in the group stages as of next year with winners pocketing $1 250 000, up from $660 000.Those teams that reach the group stage and finish at the bottom will get $550 000.There were also increases for the Africa Nations Championship which is exclusively for players plying their trade in domestic leagues, the CAF Under-20 Africa Cup ofNations, the Under-17 Africa Cup of Nations, the Women s Africa Cup of Nations, Under-23 Africa Cup of Nations and the CAF Super Cup.The changes were communicated in a letter to associations dated November 8. In view of the decision made by the CAF Executive Committee during its meeting held in Cairo, Egypt, on September 27th 2016, CAF hereby informs you of the update of the Revenues Grid detailing the allocation of revenues for national teams and clubs taking part in the final phases of CAF competitions during the four year cycle from 2017-2020. This Grid has been revised upwards, taking into consideration the renewed agreements reached with our agencies in charge of commercialising TV and marketing rights of CAF competitions. The allocations below are applicable as from January 2017. Additionally, as a policy matter, CAF will usually transfer to each team prior to the beginning of the final tournaments 50 percent of the revenue allocated to teams finishing fourth in their groups, in order to facilitate the team s preparations, reads part of the CAF letter.&nbsp;
