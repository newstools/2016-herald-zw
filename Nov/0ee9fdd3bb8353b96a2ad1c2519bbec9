MOHALI. England look set for defeat in the third Test cricket after India dominated day three in Mohali yesterday. Ravindra Jadeja led India s strong lower-order batting display with a career-best 90 before spin partner Ravichandran Ashwin wrecked England s top order to put the hosts firmly in charge. Jadeja fell agonisingly short of his maiden Test century but shared 75-plus partnerships with Ashwin and Jayant Yadav to give India, who were all out for 417, a handy first-innings lead of 134 runs. Ashwin struck three times in the final session as England, 1-0 down in the five-match series, slumped to 78-4 at the end of third day, still 56 runs behind. Reuters.&nbsp;&nbsp;
