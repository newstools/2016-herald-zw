The popular football-loving prophet has been investing in Division One football in the past three years, hoping to create a team that will battle the traditional domestic giants in the country s top-flight league.He poured money into Gunners, who failed to make the cut into the Premiership after collapsing in the final stages of their campaign two years ago.Magaya then divorced himself from Gunners by investing into his own club, Yadah Stars, who started their campaign in the ZIFA Eastern Region Division One championship this year.Coach Kuda Masaraure said earlier this year that this was just a learning curve for his men, promising they will challenge for honours next season.But Yadah Stars impressed in their debut season and, by mid-season, they had turned into serious contenders for the title.And, when they appeared to stagger towards the end of the season, Magaya, a regular figure at the club s home matches, chose to stay away, challenging his men to beat their rivals by more than two goals for him to return and cheer them.Yadah Stars responded in style.They were also full value for a crucial point they earned in Mutoko before they were awarded maximum points for their final game against Masvingo City, who failed to turn up for the fixture.Their closest rivals, Buffaloes, who only needed to win their final game at home, were held to 1-1 draw by Tenax at Sakubva.The two sides finished level on 67 points after 30 games and Yadah had a superior goal difference.
