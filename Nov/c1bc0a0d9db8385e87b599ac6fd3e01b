Yaya ToureLONDON. Pep Guardiola declared Yaya Toure is back to stay in the Manchester City squad after the midfielder s two goals earned a 2-1 victory at Crystal Palace on Saturday. Guardiola had been scathing about Toure s fitness levels earlier this season and had not given the Ivory Coast midfielder even one minute on the pitch since a Champions League soccer preliminary round tie in August.With the likes of David Silva and Ilkay Gundogan returning tired from international duty and with a vital Champions League week coming up, the City boss handed Toure a belated chance in his English Premier League line-up on Saturday and he responded in style. I would say that Yaya s performance is not about my decision. It is about his quality, Guardiola said. Yaya s a normal guy. His emotions are quiet so he was calm before the game. Yaya has trained really well for the last month-and-a-half, two months. His physical condition, his weight is better than ever and I m so happy for him and especially his family. I m so happy because he s now a real part of the team. He can help us to achieve our targets because we need all our players in order to achieve our targets. And now we have Yaya. He was in training every day with us and I m so happy for that, so glad, not (just) for today s performance. Now he is ready as the player who can play with us again. AFP.
