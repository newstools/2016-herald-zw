Thupeyo muleya Beitbridge Bureau&#8212;The Environmental Management Agency (EMA) board has raised concern over the continued dumping of solid waste in Beitbridge Town, which they say is putting the town at high risk of a recurrence of a cholera outbreak that killed hundreds of people in 2008. The board, which visited the town at the invitation of local stakeholders who are overwhelmed with the increase in solid waste, said it was important that development players cooperate to avoid a disastrous situation before the onset of the rainy season.Acting EMA board chairperson Mr Felix Moyo said the littering situation in the town, especially around the Garikayi area had reached alarming and unaccetable levels.He said the board, along with other stakeholders, was working hard to avert an imminent disaster. The EMA board came to Beitbridge in response to calls by the local stakeholders on the challenges they are facing in terms of solid waste management. If we marry it with the reports from the Meteriological Office, that we are likely to have floods this year, the dangers of another cholera outbreak is inevitable. Beitbridge is an entry point to Zimbabwe, with a population of 45 000 and another transit population of 14 000 per day. We cannot fold our hands.We have to come up with urgent interventions, he said.He said the town was littered with human waste and diapers especially, in the not-serviced residential area where there are no adequate ablution facilities and running water.He also called on the Civil Protection Unit to be on high alert for another cholera outbreak in Beitbridge.He said it was urgent for Government and private players to address the health time bomb, particularly in the northern part of the town, which houses over 2 000 housing units.Mr Moyo also challenged the local authority to consider setting up temporary blair toilets to avoid the dumping of human waste in a stream that feeds into the Limpopo River, which is also a source of water for the town. Local communities should also take charge of the local environment to avoid an unnecessary situation, he said.Town secretary Mr Loud Ramakgakpola said the local authority was working flat our to ensure that the area around the Garikayi houses is serviced to avoid the recurrence of water-borne diseases.He said they produced 600 tonnes of litter per month and they were failing to collect close to 80 tonnes due to an acute shortage of resources. We are willing to engage in private and public partnership to address the challenges we are facing in terms of service delivery. The situation around the Garikayi suburb is deplorable and we are mobilising resources to ensure that the area is serviced with sewer and water reticulation facilities, he said.
