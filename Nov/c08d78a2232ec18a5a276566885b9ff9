Dr MushohweFreeman Razemba Crime Reporter Government does not condone witch-hunting practices that have become rampant in some parts of the country, and it has not licensed anyone to conduct such practices, Information, Media and Broadcasting Services Minister Dr Christopher Mushohwe said yesterday. This comes after police yesterday also said they had noted with great concern the rampant extortion on members of the public by self-styled prophets and Tsikamutandas.In a statement, Dr Mushohwe said during a Cabinet meeting held on Monday, a decision pronouncing these rampant activities as criminal, fraudulent and extortionist was reached. Cabinet noted with much regret and concern that a significant part of traditional leaders embracing Chiefs, headmen and village heads are by commission or omission condoning this evil, primitive, extortionist and illegal practice that is condemned by our national laws. Furthermore, the unscrupulous perpetrators and accomplices of witch-hunting have misrepresented communities claiming that they had been permitted by Government authorities to carry out the illegal activity, he said.Dr Mushohwe said Government was calling upon anyone who might have fallen victim to the witch-hunters to report the matter to the law enforcement agencies so that the culprits would be brought to book and compensation paid. The Minister of Rural Development, Promotion and Preservation of Natural Cultural Heritage, Honourable Abednico Ncube has been directed to ensure that the repugnant extortionist practice is immediately brought to an end countrywide, he said.&nbsp;
