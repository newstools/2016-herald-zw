Business Reporter &#8212;The United Nations procured goods worth $76 million from Zimbabwean suppliers during the year 2015 down from $92 million in 2014, an indication that local companies have not been fully utilising the procurement system. The UN s total procurement of goods and services in 2015 totalled $17,5 billion, up from $17,2 billion recorded the previous year.Making a presentation at the Vendor Briefing and Registration Seminar in Harare yesterday UN procurement officer for the secretariat s procurement division Edward Meck said each organisation under the United Nations has its own specific requirements for goods and services. Each organisation has its own specific requirements for goods and services and may conduct its own procurement activities and follows in general, common principles for procurement rules and regulations. This constitutes a separate and distinct customer or partner tempo, portfolio and specific characteristics, said Mr Meck.On the procurement criteria Mr Meck said advertising is required for all formal solicitations with estimated value of $ 40 000 but not for informal solicitations.He said advertising generally means the announcement of the tender solicitation through the posting of a request for expression of interest on UNPD s website.Prospective vendors who respond to request for expression of interest and who are deemed qualified upon completion of an objective evaluation of their submission will receive the final tender solicitation document in addition to vendors in the centralised vendor database.Mr Meck said tender evaluation is done by the evaluation committee based on the pre-determined criteria.After the completion of the technical evaluation an award is recommended to the lowest acceptable bid.Financial evaluation will then be carried out for technically compliant proposals.An award of contract will then be recommended to the proposal with the highest combined weighted scores from the technical and financial evaluations.
