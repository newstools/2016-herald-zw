HOBART. Luck deserted Australia in their desperate bid to salvage the second Test cricket with South Africa snaring the vital wicket of David Warner in unfortunate circumstances in Hobart yesterday. Warner, who was seeking redemption after his reckless dismissal in the opening over of the first innings, lost his wicket while at the forefront of Australia s fightback.At stumps on the third day the home side were 121 for two, still 120 runs behind the Proteas, who have been in control of the Test since routing Australia for 85 on Saturday.Usman Khawaja was unbeaten on 56, his ninth Test half-century, with skipper Steve Smith not out 18.Warner flung his head back in despair when a ball from Kyle Abbott hit his hip and ricocheted off an elbow onto his stumps when he was on 45.
