This ranges from a simple Least Cost Routing (LCR) solution, to a multi-branch solution that connects various sites.Our focus on sustainable telecommunications, achieved with big and small voice solutions, ensures unmatched returns on investment, hardware, software and data capital.Our SolutionsUnified communications/VoIP solutionsVOIP technology solutions with tangible big pay-offs.The technology convergence of voice, data and broadcasting has created a technology breakthrough with huge tangible benefits and financial savings.The lowest hanging fruit being VOIP(Voice Over Internet Protocol) connectivity which enables the use of data network to make telephony calls across a WAN (Wide Area Network). The monthly fixed cost nature of data services means there is scope to move voice telephony traffic over the same network which has a fixed cost thus saving on normal internal calls.The second low level hanging fruit is savings from benefits of Video Conferencing Solutions (VCS) where transport, travel time, accommodation and food costs are saved when meetings with people from various branches and presentations are shared electronically across the WAN. This also eradicates the risks associated with road travel besides the cost elements mentioned above.The other benefits that are not so tangible are optional electronic recording of meetings and conversations, call routing, least cost routing etc which come standard with IP- PABX solutions.The epitome of communications is Unified Communication Systems (UCS) when fixed voice, data, video, mobile and e-mail are integrated.Imagine integrating your cellphone, WhatsApp contacts, with your outlook e-mail contacts and being able to phone, text, chat, teleconference, share videos, presentations on the go. Now that s what we call Unified Comms.Telephone management solutionsAt EOS, we design business expense management solutions with growth in mind. Our telephony solutions use intelligent routing, existing infrastructure and multiple service technology with sustainable convergence potential.More than that, we offer on-going telecom expense management solutions to ensure our customers gain: call cost savings, VOIP solutions for data and voice services, Least Cost Routing (LCR) and telephony abuse management.Video &amp; Teleconferencingconferencing solutionWith EOS, virtual boardroom is designed from a needs-based analysis of current Internet connection, connectivity usage, network security and existing infrastructure. And, we assess your communication needs with the next five-to-ten-years in mind enabling seamless and sustainable growth. With face-to-face business interaction, our video conferencing solutions allow you to conduct remote training and vital meetings with colleagues, clients, suppliers and partners at a click. Reach staff at home or on the road, maximising your time and reducing your travel costs.SIP/VoIP trunksA lot of enterprises are talking about SIP trunking today, but in order to be a part of the conversation you need to know: a) How is a SIP trunk different than your current PSTN/Analog trunks?, b) What are the benefits of SIP trunking?, and c) what equipment do you need to get started?To help you answer a, b and c, we ve developed this brief introduction, entitled The ABCs of SIP Trunking. The advent of Voice over IP (VoIP), however, meant that voice communications were no longer tied to circuits; they could be delivered over the Internet using SIP. SIP stands for Session Initiation Protocol, an IP-based signalling language designed to carry real-time communications (eg, voice, video, instant messaging) over IP networks. With SIP, service providers could now transmit thousands of voice sessions on a single SIP trunk over the same Gigabit Ethernet connections used for broadband Internet and data access.The immediate benefit of SIP trunking is the cost savings; session for session, SIP trunks are more than 25 percent cheaper than PSTN/traditional trunks. But SIP trunking also opens the door to operational efficiencies by combining voice and data communications on the same IP architecture, as well as providing a foundation for Unified Communications.Here are the top 5 reasonswhy enterprises shouldmigrate to SIP trunking:1. Enterprise consolidation Unlike PSTN/traditional trunks, which require a dedicated connection to every branch office, a single SIP trunk can serve an entire enterprise. This allows enterprises to combine multiple data/voice networks into a single, centralised data centre.2. Lower monthly costs SIP sessions cost less than traditional lines, sometimes by 50 percent or more. And because SIP sessions aren t bundled or locked into a specific location, enterprises can easily size up or down the number of trunks they purchase.3. Unified Communications Many enterprises are looking to combine voice, video and data applications into a single, seamless user experience. SIP trunking provides the foundation for a Unified Communications experience by delivering multimedia sessions in real time with the quality and reliability that users expect.4. Redundancy With traditional trunks, a cut circuit or hardware failure can shut down the communications network for an entire office. Because SIP trunking is centralised, enterprises can easily deploy redundant hardware to ensure high-availability communications to every office with no single point of failure.5. Advanced SIP services There are a host of exciting, new IP-based services that are only available to SIP-based networks: fixed-mobile convergence solutions, visual voicemail, IM-enhanced video-conferencing and more.
