LONDON. &#8211; Under-fire South Africa rugby coach Allister Coetzee insisted on Monday he alone was not responsible for a dreadful run of results as the battered Springboks arrived in Cardiff for the final match of their European tour. South Africa have lost seven of 11 Tests this year, equalling their record for the most defeats in a season since returning to international rugby in 1992 from apartheid-induced isolation.These include a record 57-15 defeat by New Zealand, the team that for much of rugby union s history they have challenged as the world s leading nation in the 15-a-side code, and a first home loss to Ireland.The Springboks hit a new low on Saturday as they suffered a maiden defeat by Italy, going down 20-18 in Florence as the Azzurri got the better of them for the first time in 13 attempts. - AFP.
