Arts Reporter &#8212; It seems musicians are determined to continue unleashing new material on stage despite having fresh albums on the market and Chipaz Birthday Bash set for Andy Millar Hall on November 19 will be a chance for top artistes to sample their upcoming material on the same platform. The bash will feature top musicians, most of whom released new albums this year and have begun working on new tracks for their next releases.Some of the artistes that are expected to perform are Oliver Mtukudzi, Alick Macheso, Jah Prayzah, Suluman Chimbetu, Peter Moyo, Andy Muridzo, Sandra Ndebele and Ammara Brown.On a dancehall note, Soul Jah Love, Kinnah, Freeman and Hwindi President will be leading the list of young chanters that have been invited to the bash, which is meant to celebrate promoter Partson Chipaz Chimbodza s 43rd birthday.Chimbetu and Moyo are finalising their 2016 projects and they have been sampling new songs for sometime while Macheso and Jah Prayzah who have already released new albums have begun throwing unreleased tunes in their play lists.Given the huge possibility that the show will pull a huge crowd, most of the musicians on the line-up will test the waters with their new compositions. Macheso has already hinted that he will release a new album early next year and has begun testing his upcoming songs appeal at his shows while Jah Prayzah has a similar plan.Despite the popularity of his current album Ngarizhambe , Andy Muridzo is also playing new songs as he prepares for his third album. Youngsters from the Zimdancehall sect always have something new up their sleeves and a few fresh chants will certainly be popularised on the night.Chipaz said he is overwhelmed by the zeal that musicians are showing ahead of the celebrations and he is sure a lot will happen on the day. We are expecting a lot from the musicians during the celebrations and I know a number of new songs and even bigger surprises will be the order of the day. The musicians are all raring to go and I am happy they are showing enthusiasm to celebrate with me.It is a big day for me and everyone involved in the event. I thank everyone who is working towards the event, said Chipaz.
