Callisto PasuwaWARRIOR S coach Callisto Pasuwa believes the 2018 World Cup qualifiers involving Senegal and Algeria on Saturday, gave them useful insight into how to tame the Lions of Teranga and the Desert Foxes when they face them at the African Cup of Nations in Gabon next year. Pasuwa watched the matches on television involving South Africa and Senegal in Polokwane and Algeria s showdown with Nigeria in Uyo.The Warriors mentor also dispatched his assistant Mkhuphali Masuku to Polokwane where he closely followed the match between Bafana Bafana and Senegal at the Peter Mokaba Stadium.Pasuwa said he is now looking to compare notes with his assistants, but revealed that watching two of their biggest Nations Cup Group B opponents afforded him a chance to assess the two teams.Bafana Bafana overcame Senegal 2-1 while Nigeria were more convincing 3-1 winners over Algeria.Although he was not giving away much on the weaknesses he had observed from both Senegal and Algeria, Pasuwa remains confident that his Warriors can upstage both their West and North African opponents.Senegal seemed to have problems with Bafana s style of running at them. I observed that Senegal, are a team which get easily frustrated if you score them, that is one weakness which I saw from them. Algeria are a good team most of the time, they attack with four or five of their offensive players using short passes, again on the break they are good in keeping the ball, said Pasuwa.The two World Cup qualifiers presented the Warriors technical team, players as well as the supporters with a closer look into the kind of material Zimbabwe will come up against in Gabon.However, there were mixed signals too from the local supporters with some having drawn some inspiration from the manner in which Bafana Bafana and the Super Eagles had applied themselves against Senegal and Algeria respectively.But some fans still felt the Warriors would stand no chance when they clash in Group B in Franceville with the continental heavyweights.Tunisia are the other team in Zimbabwe s group. For Pasuwa and his charges, the World Cup games involving their opponents which came as they were in camp gave them a chance to assess Senegal and Algeria as a groupSouth Africa moved top of 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifying Group D following a 2-1 win over Senegal at the Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane on Saturday afternoon.First-half goals from Bafana Bafana s Thulani Hlatshwayo and Thulani Serero saw the team move to top of 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifying round. South Africa survived late pressure from the visitors to grab all the points. Senegal s second half substitute Cheikh N Doye, who turns out for French club Angers SCO pulled one back for the visitors in the second half as the team started to find their rhythm.The Lions of Teranga were looking dangerous on set pieces.Early in the match Liverpool winger Sadio Mane was unfortunate when his header went wide while in the 24th minute Switzerland-based Moussa Konate only guided his shot straight at Bafana goalie Itumelang Khune when he had all the space.For all their high profile status, the Algerians came a cropper against the Super Eagles who will be one of the most notable absentees from the Nations Cup in Gabon.Super Eagles coach Gernot Rohr yesterday reflected on a difficult evening for Nigeria as his charges dug deep on Saturday evening.Captain John Mikel Obi scored in the first half with Victor Moses netting a brace to render Schalke 04 midfielder Nabil Bentaleb s long range stunner academic.The goal by on-loan player from Tottenham, however, might have come as a huge relief for him as he is under fire in Bundesliga from the leading German newspaper Bild which has singled him out for poor play and poor attitude.Despite the hype which met his arrival at the club, Bentaleb together with a few other players, recently were being attacked by the paper which blames them for the disastrous start in the league where they have 11 points from 10 games.Nigeria coach said they survived a second half onslaught. We had to defend well. We suffered so much in the beginning of the second half (especially) after Algeria scored. But we kept cool heads and none of my players was nervous; they were really professional which led to our third goal. The players who came on in the second half brought in something (positive) and helped us with counter attacks and that led to our third goal. We defended well and had a good organisation on (Riyad) Mahrez and (Islam) Slimane; everyone knows (these two) are very dangerous players, Rohr said at the post match press conference.The Desert Foxes named a strong starting list that included Leicester City pair of Riyad Mahrez and Islam Slimani, Carl Medjani and Bentaleb in the absence of El Arabi Soudani and other top players.The win saw Nigeria remain at the summit of Group B with six points from their opening two games.
