Snr Asst Comm CharambaFreeman Razemba Crime ReporterPolice are concerned with a surge in fatal road accidents caused by tyre bursts. Chief police spokesperson Senior Assistant Commissioner Charity Charamba told The Herald yesterday that six percent of fatal accidents that occurred in August were due to tyre bursts. The ZRP is concerned with road traffic accidents that have occurred as a result of tyre bursts. Recent statistics have established that six percent of fatal accidents (August to October31, 2016) were as a result of tyre bursts, she said.The tyre bursts were caused by using second-hand tyres or those that do not conform to technical standards, high temperatures, overloading and speeding.Other causes include incorrect tyre pressure which changes the shape of tyres.Under-inflation, tyre size and potholes have also contributed to tyre bursts.She said in one of the accidents, 10 people died when a Toyota Grand Hiace burst its rear tyre at the 369km peg along Harare-Bulawayo Road on September 16.Six more people died on September 24 along the Harare-Nyamapanda Road when a Toyota Hiace burst a tyre and overturned.In August, the Zimbabwe Republic Police and the Traffic Safety Council of Zimbabwe carried out research on accidents involving tyre bursts, following a series of fatal road ac- cidents.Indications were that the research results could lead to legislation compelling motorists who import second hand vehicles from Asia and Europe to change tyres before use in Zimbabwe.Transport and Infrastructural Development Minister Dr Joram Gumbo was quoted as saying the research had already started.The outcome of the research will assist the ministry and law enforcers to reduce road accidents. What is disturbing us is the increase in tyre burst-induced collisions. In this regard, my ministry fully supports the recent ban on importation of the second hand tyres. I am informed that ZRP and the TSCZ are carrying out research on the accidents involving tyre bursts for the first half of the year 2016. My ministry is eagerly waiting for the results of this exercise, said Dr Gumbo
