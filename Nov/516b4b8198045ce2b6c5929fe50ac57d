Margaret Matibiri: Herald ReporterAn estranged Harare woman last Thursday exposed her former boyfriend telling the civil court he dealt in illicit drugs. Florence Rumani had brought Simba Gotora before magistrate Mrs Sharon Rakafa claiming maintenance. When asked by magistrate Mrs Rakafa where Gotora was expected to get the $250 to take care of their four-month-old baby, Rumani claimed her ex-boyfriend sold illegal drugs. I want $250 from my former boyfriend for me to take care of his child since I cannot afford to do that on my own. The money will enable me to pay rentals and bills, food for both me and the child and clothes as well because we cannot roam around naked. I am asking for that amount from him because I know he can afford it since he sells illegal drugs like Broncleer and dagga and realises a minimum of $1 000 every month, said Rumani.Gotora, in his defence, told the court that he could only afford to pay $30 towards the upkeep of his child since he was a vegetable vendor. Your Worship, this woman is fabricating stories against me so that this honourable court can order me to pay maintenance in her favour. I am a vegetable vendor and I realise at most $80 every month and I cannot afford to pay the $250 that she wants as I cannot even get that per month. This child is not the only responsibility I have as I am married and also a father of two other children. I can only manage to raise $30 towards the upkeep of this child, said Gotora.Mrs Rakafa granted Rumani s maintenance application and ordered Gotora to pay $30 every month towards the upkeep of his minor child.
