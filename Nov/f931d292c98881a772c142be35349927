Brig General (Rtd) TapfumaneyiWalter Nyamukondiwa Chinhoyi Bureau &#8212;The Christopher Mutsvangwa-led war veterans executive will today meet Government as part of measures to find common ground following animosity that has cascaded to grassroot war veterans. The indaba will also seek to find ways of uniting the war veterans who have been divided, with some aligned to Cde Mandi Chimene, while others are affiliated to Mr Mutsvangwa.Secretary for Welfare Services for War Veterans, War Collaborators and Ex-detainees Retired Brigadier-General Walter Tapfumaneyi said they will include all members of the executive.Also read: War vets engage Sekeramayi President avails 13 cars to war vets No to parallel war vets structures Unite, war vets urged These include secretary-general and spokesperson Messrs Victor Matemadanda and Douglas Mahiya, respectively. We are trying to address divisions, which are in the war veterans movement, and seek to understand where they differ and try to bring convergence. The meeting ties in with a process that was started in August following the setting up of a high-level ad-hoc committee led by Zanu-PF secretary for war veterans Dr Sydney Sekeramayi.It also includes the revolutionary party s secretary for Administration Dr Ignatius Chombo, State Security Minister Cde Kembo Mohadi, War Veterans Minister Cde Tshinga Dube and all service chiefs.The process seeks to mainstream war veterans with the party Zanu-PF on the basis that the veterans cannot be an affiliate of the party, but should find space in its structures.This will see structures starting from the cell, like the Women s and Youth Leagues with full rights in the party.Rtd Brig-Gen Tapfumaneyi said the association of war veterans will continue with its advocacy work. Its not about the association and its leadership. Where they want us to assist as a ministry, we will be able to assist because we have an executive mandate to organise and unify the war veterans, he said.The Mutsvangwa-led war veterans body controls about 70 percent of the 34 000 strong body, while Cde Chimene s executive has about 30 percent.He said the ministry was not imposing a structure on war veterans, but wants them united so that they follow due processes that will lead to them choosing their leadership. We want to understand where and why we differ, and if these are matters of principle from either side, where compromises cannot be reached then it is plausible that we agree to amicably part ways, he said.
