Preparations for the 2016 edition of the annual summer camp are well on course. It is at these camps where we share ideas on how to commercialise sport as well as develop it in the country. We took a leaf from European and American countries where sport has largely been commercialised. So by holding these camps, we are trying to create a conducive platform to share ideas which could ultimately change the face of sport in the country. Several prominent local and international speakers will deliver some lectures which we believe will go a long way in hammering the right fundamentals of sport management to the participants, said Mhiribidi.He said his institute is targeting Sports Directors from schools and sports association for the seminar.Tanzania, Kenya and Zambia have all confirmed their participation at the camp, with all the countries sending both participants and presenters.Topics to be presented at the seminar include; Physical Education and Sport Career Pathways, Girl Child Impact of Physical Activity on Children, Ethical Sport Development as well as Sports Medicine with emphasis on Injury Prevention and Doping.
