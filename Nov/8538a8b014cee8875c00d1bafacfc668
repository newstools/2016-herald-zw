KINGSTON. &#8211; Multiple World and Olympic champion Usain Bolt is an underachiever according to his oldest friend. Nugent Walker (Jnr) has known Bolt since he was four years old and is now his manager. He says, even though Bolt is the most successful sprinter of all time, with nine Olympic and 11 World Championship gold medals, people around him always mock him, saying he s not fully utilised his talent. Usain is blessed with immense talent. We always tease him that he s underachieving, because we believe he is the most talented athlete we ever met upon, he told Sky Sports News. Every year, there s some injury he s had to overcome. But he s still awesome. You saw at the Olympics even though he didn t win in world record pace, you saw the gap he beat the rest of the field by. That shows how great he is. NJ says he knew from a very young age that Bolt would become a superstar &#8211; at whatever sport he chose. And at first, his friends thought he d take up cricket or football. &#8211; Sky Sports.&nbsp;
