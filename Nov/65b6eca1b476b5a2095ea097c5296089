Rev ChivaviroSophia Chese-Msowa Arts Correspondent&#8212;Award winning gospel artiste Rev Togarepi Chivaviro has come under fire from gospel artiste Daisy Mukariri who is accusing him of stealing some video clips from her upcoming project. The clips were said to be on Chivaviro s video for the song Mercy Rewrote My Life which was released two months ago.Speaking through her spokesperson Bless B identified Mukariri said Chivaviro took a video clip of her dancers and put it on his song without her knowledge and that of her dancers. I did a video shoot for my upcoming project which I wanted to release sometime this year only to be surprised when I discovered that Rev Chivaviro had used some of my clips on his own video. What pains me is that I paid the dancers, make up and everything only for someone to take what I worked for, she said.In an interview Rev Chivaviro could neither deny nor confirm stealing the clip.He confirmed that the video clips were on his video, which could have been as a result of a mix up by producers . I don t know this artiste in person but there is someone who contacted me saying a video for Mercy Rewrote My Life has one clip that belongs to her which might be a mix-up by producers there in Zimbabwe, he said.He said he has since instructed the producers to remove the said clip and release another video without that clip. I have since instructed them (producers) to remove the clip from the video because I have just contacted some professionals to do the song in question and I can say I was not directly responsible for the said clips and footages, he said.Asked how he intends to rectify the problem with Daisy, Chivaviro said he has referred her to the producer Ephraim Hawadi and his manager to solve the issue since he was far.Chivaviro who is currently based in South Africa said he was waiting for the corrected version of the video which he said would be out this week.
