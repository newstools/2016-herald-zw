JOHANNESBURG. A motion of no confidence in South Africa s President Jacob Zuma has no chance of succeeding when parliament votes tomorrow, African National Congress secretary-general Gwede Mantashe, said yesterday. The vote was called by the main opposition Democratic Alliance (DA) party last week after South Africa s anti-corruption watchdog called in a report for a judicial inquiry into allegations of influence-peddling in President Zuma s government. The DA has now made this an annual and frivolous ritual that is fast losing its meaning, Mantashe told a media briefing, referring to the no-confidence vote. This vote of no-confidence has no chance of succeeding. He added that the report did not find anyone guilty, and that calls by the opposition urging President Zuma to quit over its findings were premature .The report by the Public Protector stopped short of saying crimes had been committed, but said a judge should investigate whether President Zuma, cabinet members and some state companies acted improperly in their dealings with wealthy Indian businessmen.President Zuma denies granting undue influence to the Gupta family of business tycoons, who run a business empire from media to mining, or anyone else. The Guptas have also denied any wrongdoing.The scandal highlighted in the report has rattled investors in Africa s most industrialised country and raised the risk the stagnating economy s credit ratings will be downgraded.President Zuma (74) has already survived two no-confidence votes related to other scandals this year. His ruling ANC controls about two-thirds of the 400-member assembly. Reuters.
