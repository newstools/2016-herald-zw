SYDNEY. Former Australian captain Mark Taylor has pitched in to the debate on how to revive spectator interest in Test cricket, calling for the game s longest format to be shortened by a day to encourage more attacking intent. Test matches have witnessed a steady decline in attendances in recent years, throwing the door open to a number of novel means to engage fans, including the introduction of day-night Tests.Taylor said making tests four-day affairs instead of five would help them become more viewer friendly and envisaged a scenario where matches could begin on Thursday and end on Sunday in a manner similar to golf tournaments. It ll only add to the appeal of the game, make it a bit shorter and a bit faster, the former opening batsman told Melbourne s Sports Entertainment Network (SEN) radio station. That s what people of this generation want to see. You ve got one less day to win, lose or draw a game, so it does force captains and players to be a little bit more aggressive in their thinking. With Test matches coming in for stiff competition from the game s newer, shorter formats, such as Twenty20 internationals and leagues, Taylor added that holding day-night Tests was not the only option on the table. The numbers around the world are dying in some countries, the Cricket Australia board member said. That s why I think we have got to have the stuff like the day-night Test matches and . . . start thinking seriously about having four-day games of Test cricket. Reuters.
