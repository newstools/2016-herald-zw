Cde WadyajenaTedious Manyepo recently in GokweCORRUPT Government officials must not try to hide behind President Mugabe and Zanu-PF, but must carry their own crosses, Gokwe Nembudziya legislator Cde Justice Mayor Wadyajena has said. Addressing traditional leaders at Chief Makore s homestead in Nembudziya on Sunday where he presided over the Presidential inputs handover, Cde Wadyajena lashed out at top officials who engaged in corruption and then used the President s name to cover up for their shenanigans. Corruption is a cancer which is dragging the country s developmental efforts behind. It is surprising that some officials had nothing when they assumed their current positions but they have dramatically accrued unbelievable assets. Where are they getting the money? It is obviously a sure bet that they are engaging in corrupt activities, he said.Cde Wadyajena, who also chairs the Youth, Indigenisation and Empowerment Committee said Government officials caught on the wrong side of the law should face the music on their own without dragging the name of Zanu-PF into the mud. There are some top officials who, after being mired in corruption allegations, try to hide behind the name of the party saying they did not misappropriate the money but they used it to fund Zanu-PF projects. There is nothing like that in the country. In as much as we all know that the party needs funding, it should be known that Zanu-PF is not funded corruptly, said Cde Wadyajena.Over 400 traditional leaders who converged at Chief Makore s homestead received free cotton inputs. Cde Wadyajena urged the beneficiaries to put the inputs to good use for Zimbabwe to reclaim its bread-basket status. As I hand over the inputs which have been provided to you by His Excellency, President Robert Mugabe, I want to take this opportunity to encourage you to work hard in the coming agriculture season for the development of the country, he said.
