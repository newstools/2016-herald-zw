Abigail Mawonde: Herald Correspondent HARARE City Council says it is putting systems in place for the prevention of a potential diarrhoea outbreak during the 2016-17 rainy season. Addressing journalists in Harare last Wednesday, the city s epidemiologist Dr Kudzai Masunda, said several plans had been made to safeguard people from contracting the deadly disease. Our surveillance from previous years shows that we always have increased diarrhoeal cases during the rainy season and so far this year, before the rains have started, we have started recording increased cases of diarrhoeal cases from Week 35 and now we are in Week 44. So what we are doing as a health department of the City of Harare is that we have increased surveillance activities for diarrhoeal diseases in our communities and we have enhanced case management of these diarrhoeal cases such that if one gets diarrhoea, it is managed effectively at our health institutions, he said.Dr Masunda said the city s health department had also enhanced their follow-up on cases or suspected cases and contacts so as to reduce the spread of the disease.He said they had also increased their awareness campaigns. Dr Masunda said council had mobilised and stocked vital medicines and medicinal products to manage diarrhoeal cases. He encouraged people to practice safe habits to avoid contracting the disease. Our water situation in Harare is dire as a result of the drought situation and we are also upgrading water treatment and reticulation facilities hence we urge residents to treat all drinking water regardless of source through boiling or point of use chlorination, he said.He discouraged residents from the indiscriminate disposal of waste, but to use designated refuse disposal and sanitary facilities.
