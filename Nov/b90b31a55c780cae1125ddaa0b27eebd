LONDON. Arsene Wenger believes Mesut Ozil should be hailed as a great player because he always finds the optimal solution during games. The Germany international netted a fine solo effort to rescue a 3-2 victory over Ludogorets in the Champions League soccer on Tuesday evening. Ozil has been criticised for his inconsistency during key moments in Arsenal s previous campaigns, but Wenger believes the midfielder is one of the best in the world. You know, I would say the great players make the right decisions in the game situations they face, explained the Arsenal manager. They always make the optimal solution. To me it didn t look for a while like the optimal solution, but when the ball was in the net I thought it was! You wanted him to take maybe his chance earlier but at the end he had enough skill to prove that he was right. But Wenger has admitted that he panicked when Ozil ran through on goal against Ludogorets Razgrad.The German went clear through in the final minutes of the Champions League match, and ended up taking the ball past the goalkeeper and dummying two defenders before scoring. With the 28-year-old taking his time to score, Wenger was worried that his star player might have actually missed his chance to net the goal that sealed the Gunners passage through to the last 16.
