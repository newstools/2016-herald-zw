The event, which will be held at Elephant Hills Hotel and will run until November 22, is expected to attract 400 high profile delegates from Africa, Europe, the Middle East, Asia and North America.Issues to be discussed include how African carriers can be turned around to recapture leadership of African skies and value drivers and factors shaping the airline industry in Africa and what airlines need to do in order to be viable and competitive.In addition delegates will also discuss ways of enhancing safety and operational efficiency to develop and sustain a competitive edge and how technology can be used to achieve cost reduction and enhancement of revenues.The AGM will also see the current AFRAA president Air Zimbabwe chief executive Captain Ripton Muzenda handing over the reins to a new AFRAA president.The hosting of the AGM and summit on Zimbabwe soil is expected to reap some benefits for the host airline, Air Zimbabwe.During the launch of the AFRAA logo early this year, Transport and Infrastructural Development Minister Dr Joram Gumbo said hosting the AFRAA general assembly will be the best opportunity to look for partners to boost Air Zimbabwe. We are busy talking to several airlines who want to partner with us to revitalise Air Zimbabwe so that we can come up with one because the shopping list of partners is long since many companies are approaching us from the Middle East, China and from Europe. We are expecting that in the next three to four years Air Zimbabwe will be a leading airline in the continent, he said at the time.He added that the ministry is looking at bigger airplanes and small to complement the airline s fleet so that it can resuscitate its old routes. I am looking at possibly engaging with partners before the end of the year and it s a process, when you bring somebody to partner in such an industry which a number of countries are struggling to boost. We are we are aiming at bringing in new airlines and experts to revitalise Air Zimbabwe, he said.AFRAA has a membership of 35 airlines that include all major intercontinental African operators.The members also represent over 85 percent of total international traffic carried by African airlines. This is the third time that the annual general assembly is being held in the country.
