Minister MupfumiraPamela Shumba Bulawayo Bureau&#8212;Minister of Finance and Economic Development Patrick Chinamasa and his Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare counterpart, Cde Prisca Mupfumira, will meet within the next two weeks to discuss modalities of paying the 2016 civil servants bonuses. This was disclosed yesterday by Minister Mupfumira who said herself and Minister Chinamasa have to come up with a position regarding modalities on payment of the 13th cheque. There is no position regarding the modalities of paying the bonuses yet, but we will meet with Minister Chinamasa in the next two weeks to discuss the issue, she said.Minister Mupfumira, however, said efforts were underway to mobilise funds to pay the bonuses. We re working on strategies to improve revenue inflows to Treasury to enable Government to pay the bonuses, she said.She said Government was also working on measures to ensure payment of salaries is not delayed as well as reducing the wage bill.Sources said given the challenges Government is facing in mobilising resources to pay salaries, the payment of bonuses is likely to be staggered as was the case last year, which saw some workers being paid the 2015 bonuses mid this year.In September, Information, Media and Broadcasting Services Minister Christopher Mushohwe assured Government workers that they will receive their salaries, allowances and annual bonuses as usual.Minister Chinamasa had earlier announced in the Mid-Term Fiscal Policy Review Statement that civil servants bonuses would be suspended for two years, while their salaries and allowances would be reduced as part of measures to bring the economy back on track.
