Fungai Lupande Court ReporterA telegraphic transfer deal of $24 000 to Germany backfired after a Harare man entrusted with the transaction pocketed the school fees money. Andrew Machiha (48) of Avondale, Harare duped his former landlord after reassuring her that he was able to make the transfer.Machiha yesterday appeared before Harare magistrate Mrs Vongai Muchuchuti-Guwuriro.He is facing fraud charges and was remanded to January 1, next year on $300 bail.Prosecuting, Ms Audrey Chogumaira alleged that Machiha is the complainant s former tenant.It is alleged that sometime in May 2016, the complainant told Machiha that due to the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe s regulations she was having problems sending her children s school fees to Germany.Machiha convinced her that he was able to do the transaction for her without any difficulties.It is alleged on May 4 this year, the complainant transferred $24 000 into Machiha s CBZ bank account.The court heard that the arrangement was that Machiha was to transfer the $24 000 into the complainant s husband bank account in Germany.Two days later, Machiha confirmed receipt of the money. However, he advised the complainant that she gave him wrong Germany banking details.It is alleged that the complainant gave Machiha the banking details again.On May 7, this year it is alleged Machiha advised the complainant that he had transferred the money and it was going to reflect in Germany after seven days.The offence came to light when the complainant was advised by her husband that no money was received in his bank account.The complainant made several follow ups but Machiha allegedly became evasive prompting her to report the matter to police.She lost $24 000 and nothing was recovered.
