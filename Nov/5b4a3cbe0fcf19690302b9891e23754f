NEW YORK. Many countries pledged support for the International Criminal Court on Monday following the announced withdrawal by three African nations, but Kenya, which the tribunal is investigating, was sharply critical and questioned its long-term survival. Many in the General Assembly called for talks between the ICC and the African Union in hopes of addressing the continent s concerns and reversing the decisions to leave by Burundi, South Africa and Gambia.Kenyan Ambassador Tom Amolo didn t say whether his country would also leave, but he told the 193-member world body that his country was monitoring the withdrawals with very keen interest. Nigeria, as well as Senegal, the first country to ratify the Rome Statute that established the court, and Tanzania reiterated their support for the ICC, stressing the court s importance in combating impunity for the world s most atrocious crimes, including genocide.The ICC has been accused of bias by some African leaders because since the Rome treaty came into force in 2002, only four people have been convicted of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Three were from Congo and one from Mali. So far, it has indicted only suspects from Africa, and of the 10 full-scale investigations currently underway, nine are in Africa and only one elsewhere in the former Soviet republic of Georgia.But the ICC is expanding its global reach. It is currently conducting 10 so-called preliminary examinations probes to establish whether to open a full investigation in countries including Afghanistan, Ukraine and Colombia, as well as the Palestinian territories and alleged crimes by British forces in Iraq.
