Neville MutsvangwaTendai Gukutikwa in MutareTHE son of ousted war veterans minister, Mr Christopher Mutsvangwa, Neville Mutsvangwa who was acquitted of rape charges last month was yesterday arraigned before a Mutare court facing attempted rape, public indecency and criminal insult charges. Mutsvangwa (36) was not asked to plead to the three charges when he appeared before senior Mutare magistrate Mr Langton Mukwengi.He was charged with public indecency as defined in Section 77, criminal insult as defined in Section 95 and attempted rape as defined in Section 189 as read with Section 65 of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act, Chapter 9:23.He was, however, remanded out of custody to November 14 on $200 bail.Mr Mukwengi ordered Mutsvangwa to continue residing at house No. 42, Rossal Road, Greendale, Harare, not to interfere with witnesses and report every Friday at Highlands Police Station in Harare.Prosecuting, Mr Fletcher Karombe said the complainant, Michelle Tserai, and Mutsvangwa travelled to Vumba where they booked at Forest Hill Hotel last Friday, together with the complainant s cousin, Thandeka Shumba.It was alleged that Mutsvangwa and Tserai slept on the bed, while Shumba slept on the floor. On October 29 and at around midday, while Tserai and Shumba were bathing in an en suite bathroom, Mutsvangwa peeped through the partially closed door while the two were naked. The two caught him in the act, said Mr Ka- rombe.On the same day, Mutsvangwa is alleged to have pulled out his private parts and masturbated in the presence of Tserai and Shumba who then excused themselves to go and look for alternative accommodation leaving him alone in the room.It was further alleged that when they came back to collect their bags after having found alternative accommodation at around 7.30pm, Mutsvangwa was already asleep.Shumba collected the bags and went outside, leaving Tserai to wake Mutsvangwa up and tell him that they were moving out because he had masturbated in their presence.Mr Karombe alleged that when Mutsvangwa woke up, he begged Tserai to have sex with him, but she turned down his advances, resulting in him becoming violent and thereby grabbing her, removing her panties and tearing off her T-shirt. He went on to assault her several times all over her body.After crying for help, Tserai was rescued by felloe hotel guests and hotel staff, including the hotel manager, Mr Patrick Muponda, who took her to the police station.Mutsvangwa was last month acquitted by a Harare court of raping a 43-year-old woman at his father s offices in Fife Avenue, Harare.
