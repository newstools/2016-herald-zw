After 11 seasons as a judge on Idols South Africa radio star Gareth Cliff has decided to call it a day. Gareth made the shock announcement in a statement posted to his Facebook page yesterday. It s time! After eleven seasons of Idols it s time for me to say goodbye. What better way to bring this chapter to a close than a trip to New York and meeting American Idols judge Harry Connick Jr and being on his post-Idols show Harry Gareth wrote.Cliff would not reveal what he plans to do next only telling fans to watch this space .His relationship with Idols has been stormy after M-Net announced in January that he had been fired from the show for comments he had made on Twitter. He had been embroiled in a heated debate around estate agent Penny Sparrow and had drawn criticism for commenting that: People really don t understand free speech at all .Gareth was fired from the show but he took M-Net to court over the decision and was reinstated with M-Net ordered to pay costs. He later told reporters at a news conference that he held no grudges against the show s producers. There are great people much greater than me who suffered for our right to free expression people like Nelson Mandela who ve said let bygones be bygones.So who am I just a little ant in this picture to say anything different and especially to hold a grudge. So I say let bygones be bygones he said.Cliff recently announced an online radio collaboration with former Metro FM DJ Tbo Touch called Touch Central. SOWETAN.
