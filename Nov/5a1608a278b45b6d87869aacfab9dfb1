In terms of Section 131 (5)(b) of the Constitution of Zimbabwe, it is hereby notified that on the 20th October, 2016, the Pan African Minerals Economic Zones, 2015 Bill was transmitted to His Excellency, the President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, for his assent and signature, read one of the notice announced by Cde Chinomona.Some of the objectives of the Pan African Minerals University of Science and Technology Bill is to provide for a tertiary institution offering highly advanced post graduate courses and research in mineral value addition and beneficiation and related minerals studies. The objects of the university are: the promotion of technological innovation and knowledge-based development in mineral science. The advancement and transmission of knowledge and intellectual enquiry with a special bias towards the diffusion and extension of science of minerals; and the advancement of knowledge through teaching, research and learning; and the inculcation of excellence in academic research and community service, read the Bill.It also seeks for the promotion of moral business acumen, entrepreneurship and techno-preneurship of students in the university. The five initial programme areas to be offered would be geo-sciences, mining engineering, extractive metallurgy, materials science and engineering and any other programmes consistent with the mandate of the institution.The Special Economic Zones Bill seeks to establish zones whose thrust is to attract investment and stimulate economic growth.President Mugabe initially rejected the Bill after expressing some reservations with a clause that ousted labour rights and referred back to Parliament for it to attend to issues he had raised.The National Assembly subsequently met and accommodated his reservations before transmitting the Bill back to the Head of State and Government and Commander in Chief of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces.Chief Secretary to the Office of the President and Cabinet Dr Misheck Sibanda last week said President Mugabe had already signed the Special Economic Zones Bill, signalling the imminent gazetting of the law soon.Dr Sibanda said this at State House where President Mugabe held a meeting with a Chinese delegation that had come to explore ways to speed up the operationalisation of mega deals signed between Beijing and Harare.
