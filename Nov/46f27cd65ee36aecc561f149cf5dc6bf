JOHANNESBURG. South African Premiership soccer giants Orlando Pirates have confirmed the resignation of coach Muhsin Ertugral yesterday. Pirates chairman Irvin Khoza confirmed receipt of an email from Ertugral in which the coach tendered his resignation following the 6-1 loss to SuperSport United in the league on Tuesday night.The result was the joint worst in the history of Pirates and came despite the team leading 1-0 at half-time.Khoza says he has accepted the resignation, but was disappointed that Ertugral first addressed the issue in his post-match press conference with SuperSport after the game. We wish him (Ertugral) the best of luck wherever he is going. But I would ve loved for him to engage us first before the media, Khoza said. Ertugral joined Pirates at the start of the season from Mpumalanga Black Aces, when it had seemed he would be part of the new Cape Town City franchise that was created after the sale of AmaZayoni.
