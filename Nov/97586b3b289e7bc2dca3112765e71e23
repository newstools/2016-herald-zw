LONDON. &#8211; Brendan Rodgers says it s a sign of how far Celtic have progressed this season that the club s supporters believe they can defeat Barcelona tonight. It is a belief that would have seemed preposterous just two months ago when they watched their side trudge off the pitch at the Nou Camp after suffering a 7-0 mauling at the hands of the Catalan giants.However, positivity abounds at Celtic Park thanks in large to an undefeated start to their Scottish Premiership title defence and a place in the League Cup final, which has given them an air of invincibility domestically. Improvements in Europe have followed with solid performances in their surprise 3-3 draw with Manchester City and a 1-1 draw away to Borussia Monchengladbach, although these results sandwiched a disappointing 2-0 home defeat to the Germans. &#8211; AFP.
