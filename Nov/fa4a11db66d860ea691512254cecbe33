Some of the artistes that will perform at the bash said they are happy to work with the birthday boy.Sulu said they have a good working relationship with Cossy. I have known him for a long time and we have done a number of projects together. I will be there to sing happy birthday for him and we have prepared well for the show. We are happy to be involved in the gig. He is a friend and business partner, said Sulu.Zhakata said Cossy has done a lot for him as a promoter and a fan. For me he is more than a promoter. He is a friend and a big fan. He has been following Zora music over the past years before he decided to get directly involved in music. He was one of the organisers of my album launch this year and it went on well. There cannot be a better way of returning the favours than joining others in celebrating his birthday, Zhakata.Moyo said he regularly associates with Cossy when he passes through Kadoma on his way to Harare gigs. We meet regularly when I am travelling to and from Harare. He is a brother who has been supportive in a big way. He is assisting us in the shooting of our DVD and we are grateful for his support. We will do our best to make the event exciting. It is like performing at a gala because so many musicians will be on the line-up.
