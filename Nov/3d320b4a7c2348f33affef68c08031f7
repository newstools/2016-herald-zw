Cute umbrella can be an accessoryTafadzwa Zimoyo Fashion Talk 263&#8212; Hello fashion bugs.Wow and yippee the hot weather is cooling off and the rains are coming. The best thing one can do when it is raining is to let it rain. Having rain on your tuxedo is a pretty good reminder that you are not James Bond.There is nothing worse than getting caught in the rain unprepared.Slogging around in wet socks, wind swept hair and a totally drenched ensemble is no way to spend your day.It s just downright unpleasant.The problem is, rain is incredibly difficult to dress for.Showers can be spotty, which brings about changing temperatures and so far some fashion bugs are panicking on what to wear and wanting to know any outfit ideas for rainy days.It can definitely be tough to dress for a rainy day because there are so many things to consider.From what type of material you can wear (suede shoes are a no-go) to how to stay dry without sacrificing style, dressing well when it s rainy requires a little planning in advance.Anyway don t worry, though, most people think to dress for a rainy day is easier than summer.A classic trench coat is always perfect for rainy weatherBut alas we have noticed some wardrobe malfunction during the season and with awards season still upon us we now wonder what are we going to see.Sticking to that today there is the so called controversial Zimbabwe Radio Awards and we can t wait to see how our local celebrities will be donning.We hear that there is a red carpet affair and people are expected to come dressed in their best as those who have managed to steal the show will walk away with best dressed award.It is a fact that Zimbabweans are the best when it is about moving with times, so don t be shocked seeing someone today wearing trench-coats and obvious famous boots that are already trending in United Kingdom.Since the rains are upon us here is a quick guide to remain fashionable.Just know that no matter what season don t be scared to wear something bright and fun on a rainy day.Bad weather can be depressing, so why not go out of your way to wear something non-depressing and cute?Yes add colour.A cute umbrella can be an accessory.There are so many adorable and cheap umbrellas available at stores, so there s really no excuse to stick to basic black. Buy a couple in your favourite colours if you live in a really rainy area and use them to add colour to your look.A classic trench coat is always perfect for rainy weather.There aren t many inexpensive and cute trenches in stores right now as it s summer.The trench coat is such a classic and essential piece that s perfect for all occasions and especially rainy days.Again be careful of the materials you wear in rain.I m sure you probably know this already, but just in case . . . suede is off-limits in rain because water usually ruins it, and leather that hasn t been treated with a protectant can easily be damaged by water as well.Don t risk ruining your clothes go with rubber, pleather, or protectant-treated leather shoes in rain and leave your favourite suede handbag at home.At the same time, don t worry too much about a 100 percent waterproof jacket.If you plan ahead and have your umbrella on hand, your jacket won t get wet enough for waterproofing to matter.Just go crazy when it comes to rain boots.Don t wear delicate fabrics like silk, or light colours like white but opt for something sturdy and simple in a dark shade.I mean don t let your top be the after thought of your rainy day ensemble.A long-sleeved breathable tee or light-weight sweater makes a great base for your raincoat.You will make layering look oh so easy.Heavy trousers with lots of body are a no factor but rather pick slim pants in a lightweight, quick dry fabric.I remember one local fashion blogger and personal friend Lillian Madyara affectionately known as Hollywood Lee said go for black, as it won t show signs of rain or muddy debris. When it s wet and windy, your best bet is a pair of skinny trousers for gents or leggings for ladies. They ll hold their shape even if you re drenched or caught in a chilling gust of wind. They will also dry quickly, which means you won t be sitting at your desk soaked all day, she said.Well, there are so many cute rain boots out there today to fit any sense of style they literally come in every colour under the sun.Have fun and find a pair you love!Much like umbrellas, you can go completely nuts with your rain boots and no one will mind.Enjoy your lovely weekend.
