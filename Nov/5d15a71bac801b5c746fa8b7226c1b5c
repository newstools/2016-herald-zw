Nyemudzai Kakore Herald CorrespondentSAM Levy s Village has dismissed security guards who protested their employer s cruel and inhuman treatment of a fellow employee who was allegedly forced to carry a huge concrete block from Avondale to Borrowdale, as punishment last month. Flint Chisuko, Patrick Zhuwawo and Stephen Banda were dismissed on October 31, and they are appealing to Government to intervene since they maintained that they were unfairly dismissed.The trio was fired after they had demonstrated against the punishment meted on their workmate only identified as Madziro.Madziro was manning his boss residence in Avondale when he was caught sitting on concrete rubble by Mr Morris Levy.Levy allegedly accused Madziro of neglecting his duties.Levy is alleged to then have ordered Madziro to carry a huge block on his head from Avondale to Sam Levy s Village with a car following him to ensure that he complied with the order.Head of security Charles Kapfupi confirmed to The Herald that Mr Levy had fired the security guards.Kapfupi claimed that the three security personnel misrepresented facts, turned violent and refused to seek dialogue with management during the protest. Efforts were made to go through the hearing process, but the three refused to cooperate with the procedure and decided to be paid out all what was due to them, he said. As a result of their uncooperative behaviour, the hearing was stopped and the designated officer recommended to management the payment and termination of services by mutual consent as per wish of the complainants. The security guards however denied claims that they agreed to have their contracts terminated. We were unfairly dismissed from employment because of the peaceful demonstration we staged. We are appealing to the Government to intervene so that we return to work. How can we be unfairly treated in our country said Zhuwawo.When The Herald interviewed Madziro, he confessed to being punished, but said his life was not in danger.He said it was his choice to carry the block from Avondale to Sam Levy s Village as he is an athlete used to jogging and running on the same route .
