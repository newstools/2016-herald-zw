SAO PAULO. Lewis Hamilton warned Nico Rosberg he was hunting a fourth world Formula One title after describing his stunning triumph in Sunday s wet and chaotic Brazilian Grand Prix as one of the easiest of his 52 career victories. The 31-year-old Briton won in Brazil for the first time at the 10th attempt to complete a hat-trick of consecutive wins and keep alive his championship defence, taking the title battle down to the wire at the final race, the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix on November 27. I m hunting and all I can do is what I am doing, said a delighted Hamilton, who trails his Mercedes team-mate and championship rival Rosberg, who finished second on Sunday, by 12 points with one race remaining. The team have given me a great car and finally the reliability has been good. Right now, I am living in the moment. This was my dream when I was five or six, watching Nelson (Piquet) and Ayrton (Senna) race. It was one of my easier races, I didn t have any spins, any moments. It was pretty straightforward. AFP.
