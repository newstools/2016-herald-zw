Bipin Dani in MUMBAIZIMBABWE coach Heath Streak is happy with the tied result in Saturday s tri-nations cricket showdown against the West Indies at Queens Sports Club in Bulawayo. Donald Tiripano bowled a magical last over to help Zimbabwe and the Windies tie an entertaining match. I am happy for a tie even though we could have won the match had we fielded properly , Streak said. The result has kept us alive in the series so, yes, we are satisfied. Zimbabwe captain Graeme Cremer went against tradition and chose to bat first after winning the toss. It was our collective decision to bat first. Statistics can sometime be misleading when not many matches are played on a ground, said Streak. It (Queens Sports Club) is my home ground so I know the wicket would be harder to bat second. We had the chances and as the end proved it wasn t easy to bat when ball got older. We lost last six wickets for 60 runs, had we finished better than 280 it would have been tough to eclipse. Donald Tiripano s last over yielded three wickets, however, no credit for two run-outs. India s C. Shamsuddin was an umpire and Javagal Srinath the match-referee. It was 150th ODI appearance for the local umpire Russell Tiffin.
