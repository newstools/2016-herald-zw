Donald TrumpLIMA. Mexico s President Enrique Pena Nieto said on Saturday that his government will seek a dialogue with US President-elect Donald Trump, who infuriated Mexicans with vitriolic attacks on their country and its people during his campaign. In the face of the positions that President-elect Trump has taken, we are prioritising dialogue as a path to build a new agenda for our bilateral relations, Pena Nieto said at a summit of Asia-Pacific leaders. For Mexico, our relation with the United States is central, given the level of trade and integration we have now, he added during a roundtable on trade in Lima, Peru. AFP.
