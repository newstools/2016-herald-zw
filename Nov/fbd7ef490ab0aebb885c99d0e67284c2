After some careful deliberations following the Charles Manyuchi boxing success story, we decided as a council to avail a piece of land for a world-class sports centre. We have partnered Manyuchi in doing so. So as I speak, work has already commenced at the site. The centre will incorporate all sporting disciplines, he said.Manyuchi, who is also preparing for his next fight against a yet-to-be named opponent next February, said the council s gesture was a welcome development. This is a brilliant idea coming from brilliant people. They approached me and said they wanted to avail such an expanse of land for the purpose of sports development. The gesture was a welcome one, considering that young people need to sharpen their skills at an early age. The facility will go a long way in developing the sport in the country, he said.
