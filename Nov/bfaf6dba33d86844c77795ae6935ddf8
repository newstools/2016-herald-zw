MANCHESTER. Juan Mata insists nothing happened between him and Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho in the past and branded talk of a rift as lies . Mata was sold to United by Mourinho when he was manager of Chelsea in 2014, and a string of national newspapers reported an acrimonious break-up. The midfielder admits even his friends and family were concerned when Mourinho took over at Old Trafford in the summer, but he has become an integral part of the Portuguese s team and insists he is enjoying his football. Too many things were said, too many stories were created as well lies, he said. When the manager came in, I was always thinking the same as I have always thought; I am going to give my best, and I believe in myself, and I think this can work out . Your family and friends are ringing to know what is going on, but I always told them the same; Listen, I am the one that knows what is going on and I know that nothing is going on . Sky Sports.
