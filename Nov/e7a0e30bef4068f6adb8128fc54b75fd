LONDON. Pep Guardiola insists that he does not want Sergio Aguero to take after Luis Suarez as the two strikers prepare to face off in Manchester City s Champions League soccer encounter with Barcelona tonight. Suarez scored a phenomenal 59 goals in 53 appearances as Barca claimed Spain s domestic double and the Club World Cup last season and is already onto 10 in 14 games this term.Those numbers are outstripped by Aguero, whose double in City s 4-0 win at West Brom on Saturday took him to 13 in 13 for 2016-17.Camp Nou was deprived of a showdown between the two forwards when Guardiola surprisingly left Aguero on the bench before 10-man City slumped to a 4-0 loss at his old stamping grounds two weeks previously.The former Barca and Bayern Munich boss s calls for Aguero to improve his all-round game were noticeably softened at the weekend, with Guardiola insisting that the 28-year-old is at that level when his penalty-box prowess is set against the likes of Suarez and Lionel Messi. Nevertheless, the City manager maintains that Aguero can be spoken of alongside the world s best on his own terms.Asked by reporters whether he wanted Aguero to play more like Suarez for the Premier League leaders, Guardiola replied: The quality from Luis Suarez is his qualities. I don t want those qualities Aguero has his own qualities. I want to help Aguero to achieve his huge qualities as much as possible. That s what it is. He has some qualities and I cannot ask Sergio to do what Luis Suarez does because it would be unfair. Goal.com.
