My album talks about societal settings, hinting on some of the solutions and I am so excited about the release of it. The album features some other tracks by Simon Mutambi, T Makwikwi and Cee Jay produced by Malon Tee, he said.Asked who his role model was, Somplex said was inspired by Winky D. My dream is to do a collab with Winky D and also Jah Prayzah. I do my genre with little fusion of jazz. I started music in 2015 after noticing that I have the talent and my friend persuaded me to record an album, he said.Somplex grew up in Mutare before relocating to Chitungwiza. Recently, he hosted a show at Beatrice Motel and Bindura Piki bar in an effort to market the album.The musician said he was working on producing videos for the album which will be released next year if all goes well. Currently, upcoming musicians are sidelined and not well respected in terms of shows. Give them opportunity to shine and pay them adequately for their shows. I am working on shooting videos for the album.
