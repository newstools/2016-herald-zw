PERTH. Emerging South African paceman Kagiso Rabada claimed three crucial wickets as South Africa closed in on victory against Australia on the fourth day of the opening Test cricket in Perth yesterday. Set an intimidating victory target of 539, the home side were wobbling on 169 for four at stumps and facing a potential record defeat against South Africa. Usman Khawaja was on 58 and Mitchell Marsh on 15, with South Africa s unbeaten record at the ground set to be extended. An extraordinary piece of fielding by the diminutive Temba Bavuma removed the dangerous David Warner for 35 to end an opening stand of 52.Warner dropped the ball in front of him and set off for a quick single, but Bavuma pounced from cover and unleashed a powerful throw while horizontal and still in mid-air. It rattled the stumps at the non-striker s end with Warner centimetres out of his ground. The dismissal set the stage for Rabada (3-49) to display his quality in the absence of champion pacemen Dale Steyn due to a shoulder injury suffered on the first day.Four balls later fellow opener Shaun Marsh (15) was caught at second slip by Faf du Plessis off the bowling of Rabada as Australia suddenly slumped to 52-2.Things appeared to get even darker for the hosts when new batsman Khawaja was given out caught behind first ball against the part-time spin of JP Duminy. A decision review saved Khawaja when it showed the ball had glanced off his pad rather than the bat.Steven Smith and Khawaja, who was dropped on 41 when Hashim Amla could not cling on to a tough chance at first slip, set about rebuilding the Australian innings in search of a draw.
