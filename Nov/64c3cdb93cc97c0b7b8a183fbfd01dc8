Sharon RutsitoTawanda Marwizi Arts Correspondent &#8212; Model Sharon Rutsito has engaged a local company Classic Super Foods in a project for the disadvantaged. Last week Rutsito donated foodstuffs to Chinyaradzo Children s home and more are set to taste the model s extended hand this week. I am glad that together with Classic Super Foods we have started the project, hopping to reach as many as we can, she said. We have a role to play in the society and my dream is to get this bigger. The good part is Classic Super Foods are willing to work with me on many projects, she said. With the help of such organisations we will be doing a lot to several of these disadvantaged people. Classic Foods managing director Donald Musinga said they will work with the model on several community projects. Engaging Rutsito means we are taking social responsibility to the community through someone who can inspire people out there, he said.He said Rutsito was a disciplined model and they would work with her to reach out to different charity institutions. Matron of Chinyaradzo Children s home Irene Karadzandima thanked Rutsito and the organisation for their kind gesture.&nbsp;
