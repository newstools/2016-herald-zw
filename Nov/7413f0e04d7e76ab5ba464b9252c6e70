LONDON. &#8211; Gareth Southgate said he has shown he can handle big matches after concluding his four-game tenure as England s interim manager with a 2-2 friendly draw against Spain. Appointed caretaker manager in the wake of Sam Allardyce s departure, Southgate led England to two wins and two draws in his brief stint at the helm, culminating in Tuesday night s result at Wembley.He has refused to declare an outright interest in the position, which will now be discussed by England s Football Association, but expressed pride at having given a good account of himself. I ve proved to myself I can manage big matches, that with the help of my staff I can tactically prepare the team to play a top side and give them a really tough test, Southgate told reporters. I feel every situation we ve been through &#8211; many of which have been complex and potential powder kegs &#8211; we ve coped with very well. - AFP.
