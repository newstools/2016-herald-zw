LONDON. Daniel Sturridge has hit back at claims he is selfish and insists his status as team player for England is being unfairly questioned. The Liverpool striker set England on their way to a 3-0 win over Scotland on Friday with the opening goal and also began the attack which led to Adam Lallana s match-clinching second but there was a lack of warmth in the ovation he received when substituted in the 73rd minute. Sturridge came in for criticism after last month s 0-0 draw against Slovenia in Ljubljana and he was the subject of some mocking videos on the internet, the most notable of which was a clip of Alan Partridge shouting Dan! Dan! repeatedly to mimic exasperated team-mates when they never received a pass from him. Mailonline.
