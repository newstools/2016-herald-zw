LONDON. &#8211; In the technical area, on the bench, in the stands, in the dressing-room, wherever, it doesn t really matter. Jose Mourinho is becoming a specialist in not winning football games at Manchester United. Kicking bottles, ranting at referees, it doesn t really matter. Jose Mourinho is finding more and more ways not to win football games. Four home league matches, varying levels of domination, same outcomes. Four home league draws, eight points squandered, too many teams rapidly becoming too far removed for United to have a serious title claim. It is that serious.For Mourinho himself, he has won only 10 of his last 31 English Premier League fixtures. No United side of the Premier League era has had fewer points after the opening 13 matches of the season.Mourinho used 50 percent of his programme notes to bemoan United s misfortune. So let s get one thing clear. United were not unlucky, they were wasteful and, at times, distinctly unimaginative in attacking areas.Mourinho should not allow his players to be lulled into this idea that they are being punctured by arrows of outrageous fortune.In terms of chances, West Ham might even claim they deserved parity even though, after taking a 90-second lead, they shrunk into a defensive shell for a long spell.It was a simple opener.Zlatan Ibrahimovic is fond of imagining statues of himself. Well, there was one in Manchester and it was marking Diafra Sakho when Dimitri Payet dipped a free-kick on to his striker s head. &#8211; The Daily Mirror.
