LAS VEGAS. Floyd Mayweather accepted an invite to watch Filipino icon Manny Pacquiao s WBO welterweight title fight on Saturday night, leaving many wondering if a request to step back in the boxing ring would be next. Mayweather had a front row seat at the Thomas &amp; Mack Center to watch Pacquiao easily beat former champion Jessie Vargas with a unanimous decision victory. Pacquiao said on Sunday that he is eager to avenge his 2015 loss to Mayweather and doesn t feel the contract negotiations would be nearly as acrimonious as they were for the first fight, which became the richest in boxing history. Not only for myself, but the fans of boxing want the rematch then why not? Pacquiao told a group of reporters at his luxury suite at the Wynn hotel and casino. We can easily talk about that it is not a problem. Because we now have direct contact to them it would be easier to talk about when there will be a rematch. Pacquiao looked impressive on Saturday and even showed his power with a second-round knockdown as he reclaimed the WBO welterweight title the same belt he lost to Mayweather. AFP.&nbsp;
