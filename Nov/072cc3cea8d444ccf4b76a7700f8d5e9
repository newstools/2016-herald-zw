Herald ReporterFORMER Herald news editor and Zimbabwe National Editors Forum (Zinef) treasurer Oliver Gawe, who died last Sunday in Lesotho, was buried at Warren Hills Cemetery in Harare yesterday. Gawe, who was 56, was now working in the mountain kingdom. Journalists across the media fraternity, from former Herald Editor Tommy Sithole to former Chronicle editor Geoff Nyarota, converged at Warren Hills to pay their last respects to the veteran journalist. Paying his tributes, Funny Mushava, who worked with Gawe, said:. The death of Oliver has been a unifier. Journalists from the privately owned media and the public media were all at Warren Hills. They were all in agreement that Oliver should not have died in a foreign country, said Mushava. This is a person who, for the first time, has been buried by journalists. It was a moving ceremony. Gawe joined The Herald in the mid-1980s as part of a group of young journalists who took over the then white-dominated newspaper. He also worked as deputy editor of Parade magazine. Family spokesperson Mrs Alice Skipe said the former news editor suffered from a heart problem. My brother was suffering from a heart problem and high blood pressure. It is disheartening that he had to die in a foreign country without his close relatives close by, she said.Gawe is survived by his wife, seven children and five grandchildren.
