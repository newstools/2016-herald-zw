From George Maponga in MasvingoVillagers in Budzi communal lands, Bikita, are up in arms with the Save Valley Conservancy operators over failure to plough back into the community, amid reports that operators were dragging their feet in meeting their obligations under the Communal Areas Management Programme for Indigenous Resources (Campfire). The villagers accuse Save Valley operators of turning a blind eye to them despite the damage caused to their property and crops by wildlife that stray into their settlements from the northern part of the wildlife-rich park.The northern part of Save Valley, which borders Bikita, is owned by companies and individuals whose properties are protected under the Bilateral Investment Protection and Promotion Agreement (BIPPA). Villagers adjacent to these properties accuse the operators of frustrating efforts to start Campfire projects with plans to set up the Chiefs Trust still to materialise.The Chiefs Trust will see chiefs around Save Valley, namely Mabika, Gudo and Tshovani getting an annual financial injection from the conservancy to develop their communities, most of which bear the brunt of marauding wild animals.Bikita villagers are also unhappy that the rural district council has not been remitting funds to their areas from the Umkondo Conservancy initiative which is part of Save Valley. Bikita Rural District Council chief executive Mr Peter Chibi confirmed that there was no Campfire programme for villagers in his district adjacent to Save Valley. It s (Campfire) something that can be started but, as of now, we do not have the programme for Bikita villagers around Save Valley. The reasons for the absence of the Campfire programme for the villagers remain a mystery, but there are efforts to do something, he said.&nbsp;
