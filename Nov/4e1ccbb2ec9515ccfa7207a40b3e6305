DURBAN. Dr Tumi dominated at last Sunday night s ninth Crown Gospel Music Awards at the ICC in Durban by taking five trophies, including the coveted Song of the Year for his hit Nothing Without You. The medical doctor-turned-musician was almost out of words each time he was called up to receive yet another award.Lebo Sekgobela took the Best Female Artiste award. Earlier yesterday, streets in Durban were buzzing as gospel stars scrambled for last-minute votes from fans.Nominees in the tough best gospel artiste category, included Andile KaMajola, Sfiso Ncwane and Dumi Mkokstad, were all over the streets before the big night, urging the public to vote for them.The multi-award-winning gospel stars competed with the eventual stars of the night, Dr Dumi and Sekgobela.Fans were thrilled by the appearance of the stars who were travelling in their face-branded vehicles. Fans were chanting their names and singing their songs .Zanele Mngoma backed Ncwane and was happy to see him. He is my favourite gospel artiste and I have voted for him, Mngoma said.Khosi Gwala, KaMajola s fan, should be disappointed that her favourite artiste did not win the coveted award. It should be the same with Mkokstad s fans who went all out to vote for him. This after Mkokstad also took it to social media by asking his fans to send him airtime so that he could vote for himself on their behalf.Zinhle Thwala revealed that he had sent R50 airtime to Mkokstad s number. I m not sure whether he was broke or not but he asked those who are busy with other things to send him airtime so that he will vote for himself. SOWETAN.
