MADRID. &#8211; Breaking Atletico Madrid s recent stranglehold on a fixture that used to be a foregone conclusion for Real Madrid is the challenge facing coach Zinedine Zidane ahead of tomorrow s derby, the last at the Vicente Calderon stadium. Real enjoyed utter domination over their rivals for 14 years but the tables have turned and they have not won a league derby since Jose Mourinho oversaw a 2-1 win at the Calderon in 2013.Atletico have won four and drawn two of the last six league derbies, just one demonstration of how charismatic Argentine coach Diego Simeone has transformed the fortunes of the sleeping giant he took over in December 2011. He is a coach with a unique capacity to communicate, that s why he has got where he is and why he was able to dig us out of the trouble we were in, said Atletico captain Gabi, who has won the La Liga title, King s Cup and reached two Champions League finals under Simeone. With one look or gesture he s able to speak to any player, and that s why at the moment the most important thing for this club is the fact we have Simeone with us. Real still have the upper hand on their neighbours in European competition and tomorrow s game is the first meeting between the teams since Real s penalty shootout victory in the Champions League final last May. - Reuters.
