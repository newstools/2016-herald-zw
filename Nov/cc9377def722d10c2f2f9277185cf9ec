Arts Correspondent &#8212; A change of heart or, rather, attitude by venue owners? That is what is happening at Club Fortress located at the New Ambassador Hotel along Kwame Nkrumah Avenue. Unlike other seedy nightclubs dotted in the city centre, Club Fortress is a hangout dedicated to rhumba. It has been three months since it opened its doors to patrons and already the hangout is drawing scores of avid rhumba lovers.The no-under-21 club is open beginning on Thursday right through to Sundays with DJs on rotation playing nothing but the very best in rhumba music. According to the owners, the club is like a stronghold for rhumba aficionados and have everything to prove it.There are big screens and a projector mounted on the walls and the DJs just don t play CDs but DVDs which are beamed live on the screens. The impression one gets is that of a live show and patrons can learn one or two dance moves from the experts.Already, Friday nights are the most popular with a cool mix of rhumba and Naija vibes courtesy of DJ Dollarbill. But Sundays, the DJs will rock you with old skool rhumba then later things get turned up with the latest numbers being the order of the night.Even the patrons who are thronging the venue are familiar with dress code and the cool ambience, the lights and the powerful sound which makes them to get up and dance. Some of the DJs on the roster include Ben aka Rhumba Network, Buzie the Maestro, Dollarbill aka Naija Vibes who are supported by Sir Agbada.According to the proprietors Reynold Mhike of Evonic Events and Joe Hweva Mvura of Dollarbill Entertainment, rhumba music still appeals to the mature. We have realised that rhumba music is still popular among mature listeners but there is no single club that is catering for that market. At Club Fortress we respect the privacy of our patrons and whatever happens in the club stays in the club. While we are located at the New Ambassador Hotel we have maintained club prices for our beverages, Mhike said.
