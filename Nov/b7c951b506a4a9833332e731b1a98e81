ELEVEN Bulawayo primary schools took part in the opening day of the 5th edition of the Lakers Foundation Basketball Tournament which started at Eveline High School and Khanyisile Sports Club. The schools participating in the development competition which is being pioneered by Lakers Foundation are Sigombe, Mgoqo, Mtshane, Inkanyezi, Emakhandeni, Mpumelelo, Insukamini, Zulukandaba and Hyde Park.Lakers Foundation founder and tournament director Sikhumbuzo Ndlovu said, In the last four editions we ve been focusing on secondary schools and clubs but we are taking a different turn now, coaching primary schools. We believe that the foundation of basketball is at primary schools and if we are to do well in sport we ve to identify, nurture and develop talent at grassroots level which are primary schools. The turn-up has been great considering that this is the first edition of the primary schools tournament. Our aim is to raise awareness and demonstrate that basketball is a sport with a series of development. In order to have a better and much stronger team we need to catch these players at a younger age so that we are able to identify and nurture talent. Once we identify talent we will be able to channel these kids in the right direction, said Ndlovu.He said 30 teams, including 11 teams from Zambia, Malawi and Botswana have registered to take part in the tournament.Ndlovu urged participants to demonstrate sportsmanship during the four-day event. In the senior tournament we expect fireworks because we have teams from Zambia, Malawi and Botswana. For the seniors, this is an opportunity for the players to demonstrate their skills and size each other as they try to impress their national team coaches in preparation for the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) competition which is scheduled for February next year, said Ndlovu.
