From Noah Pito in HurungweA 64-year-old Hurungwe woman wept in court last week after her violent son was sentenced to 315 hours of community service. Margaret Mazodze had expected a lengthy custodial sentence for her violent son Freddy Mazodze (28) who had assaulted her with an aluminium pot, causing injuries on her body.Freddy was charged with physically abusing his mother as defined in Section 3(a)(i) of the Domestic Violence Act Chapter 5:16 when he appeared before Karoi magistrate Mr Obedience Matare last Friday.He admitted to assaulting his mother with a pot before the magistrate sentenced him to 11 months in prison.Mr Matare conditionally suspended two months of the sentence for five years.The remaining nine months were also set aside on condition that Freddy performs 315 hours of unpaid work at Nyamahape Secondary School beginning from Monday, November 7.On October 11, Freddy, a gold digger in 4A Nyamahape area where he also lives with his mother came back home around 6pm and saw her sitting outside the kitchen hut with Sekai, one of his sisters.After he was offered opaque beer by his mother, he went into the kitchen for some time before he later emerged with an aluminium pot in his hand.Freddy started striking his mother on the head and all over the body forcing her to run away.But as she ran away, he followed her and continued to beat her with the pot, inflicting severe injuries on her.According to a medical report produced by Dr Mutisi of Karoi Hospital, the mother sustained a cut on the upper third of the right thumb leading to traumatic amputation from the top to nail bed.She also sustained serious injuries all over the body although they are not life threatening.
