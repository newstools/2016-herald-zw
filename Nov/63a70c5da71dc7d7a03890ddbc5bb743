Dr-Samuel-Sipepa-NkomoBulawayo BureauFormer People s Democratic Party (PDP) vice president Dr Samuel Sipepa Nkomo has likened his former party to a luxurious bus without wheels. Dr Sipepa Nkomo recently defected to the Zimbabwe People First (ZimPF) led by former Vice President Dr Joice Mujuru. Addressing ZimPF, supporters in Ntabazinduna on Saturday, Dr Sipepa Nkomo said he left PDP because it was directionless. The reason I left PDP is that we were like people sitting in a luxurious bus without wheels. We were happy in the bus chanting slogans, but the bus didn t have wheels, so it could not move, said Dr Sipepa Nkomo.He also took a swipe at MDC-T leader Morgan Tsvangirai, describing him as a womaniser. Dr Sipepa Nkomo said Mr Tsvangirai was rejected by the people from Matabeleland whom he said had switched to Dr Mujuru s party.He urged the divided ZimPF, which has seen some of its members resigning from the party to stick with Dr Mujuru.He said failure to do so will result in the party collapsing. She is a stone that the builders rejected, but the rejected stone has become the cornerstone, he said.Responding to Dr Sipepa Nkomo claims, PDP s national spokesperson Jacob Mafume said the party would not waste its time responding to a man who has reached retirement age. We will not stoop so low to the extent of exchanging insults with our elderly people who need to be enjoying their retirement. We live in a country where there is freedom of expression and freedom of opinion, said Mafume.Tsvangirai s spokesperson Luke Tamborinyoka could not be reached for comment.
