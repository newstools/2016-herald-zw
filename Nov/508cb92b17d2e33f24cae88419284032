Samantha Chigogo Herald Correspondent&#8212;Popular Ghanaian preacher Evangelist Dag Heward-Mills who is in Zimbabwe for a month-long outreach programme, has since attracted over 60 000 people at the ongoing Healing Jesus Crusades held so far. The crusades, which began last week, are set to run till December 10 in several cities and towns, namely: Harare, Bulawayo, Gweru, Kwekwe, Kadoma, Victoria Falls, Mutare, Chitungwiza, Bindura, Marondera, Masvingo, Zvishavane, Gwanda and Beitbridge.Speaking to The Herald, Healing Jesus International Crusade director, Reverend Edo Ankrah said the crusades were of major significance in uniting Zimbabweans under one purpose. The Healing Jesus Crusade is a non-denominational, evangelistic outreach ministry, which partners with all local churches and Christian organisations, where the crusade goes, he said.The Zimbabwe campaign has seen the Healing Jesus Campaign partnering with the Evangelical Fellowship of Zimbabwe, Zimbabwe Council of Churches, Zimbabwe Catholic Bishops Conference, the Union for the Development of Apostolic Churches in Zimbabwe (Udaciza) and others.He also said there is a manifestation of miracles during the crusades, with the blind receiving their sight, the lame walking, scores receiving their deliverance from demonic oppression, and more.Rev Ankrah said Evangelist Dag and his crusade team held 132 evangelistic crusades since 2004 and have seen over 10,5 million decisions made for Christ, with the crusades having taken place in every country in West Africa, the Kingdom of Swaziland, Lesotho and 28 cities in South Africa.He said crusades were also popular for providing the Healing Jesus Medical Mission outreaches. These outreaches, wherever applicable are committed to spreading the love of Christ by providing free healthcare; visits to orphanages, old people s home, schools of the disabled and blind just to mention a few, in the rural and underprivileged populations in the crusade locations. However, in this case this will not be applicable during this mission, Rev Ankrah said.Evangelist Dag is a well sought-after speaker internationally, who is frequently called upon to declare his messages that encourage pastors to continue in the work of the ministry.With a ministry spanning nearly thirty years, he has authored several books with 45 best-sellers, including; The Art of Leadership , Loyalty and Disloyalty , and The Mega Church and his books are currently in 31 languages.Bishop Dag serves on a number of international boards, which include the International World Pentecostal Fellowship USA, Pentecostal World Fellowship Malaysia, Church Growth International Dr David Yonngi Cho South Korea, Association of Charismatic and Christian Churches in Ghana.A medical doctor by professions, he is married to Mrs Adelaide Heward-Mills.
