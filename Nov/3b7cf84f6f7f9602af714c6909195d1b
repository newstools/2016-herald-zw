LONDON. &#8211; His season had already provided several unforgettable chapters but Andy Murray saved the best to last as he eclipsed Novak Djokovic 6-3, 6-4 to claim his first ATP World Tour Finals title and rubberstamp the year-end top tennis ranking on Sunday. Against a man who has so often been his nemesis, Britain s golden boy Murray produced a relentless display to claim a ninth title of a year which included a second Wimbledon crown and Olympic gold in Rio.Murray s play in the winner-takes-all season climax was all the more remarkable as a day earlier he looked on the point of mental and physical exhaustion after taking almost four hours to subdue Milos Raonic in the semi-final.It would have been blow to Murray s solar plexus if, two weeks after dislodging Djokovic from the top ranking, the Serb had ripped it back with a fifth consecutive Tour Finals title.But his powers of recovery appear limitless as he handed an error-prone Djokovic a bitter defeat that will leave a sour taste in the 12-times major champion s mouth as a new season swings into action in a few weeks.On this evidence the Scot may enjoy his new status for some time.Murray double-faulted twice in the first game and there was a wobble near the end as Djokovic mounted some late resistance, but with the majority of the 17 000 fans in the O2 Arena willing him on, Murray completed the job. It s very special playing against Novak in a match like this, we ve played grand slam finals and at the Olympics before, but I am very happy to win and to be world number one is very special. It is something I never expected, Murray said.Murray also believes the best years of his career could still be ahead after confirming his status as world number one by beating Djokovic to claim the ATP Tour Finals crown on Sunday.Murray (29) became the oldest man since 1974 to reach the top of the rankings for the first time last month and the way he dominated the final months of the season, winning five titles and 24 matches in a row, suggests he could be right. &#8211; Reuters.
