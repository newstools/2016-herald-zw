Faith Mutema Sports ReporterZIMBABWEAN equestrian rider, Camilla Kruger, bagged the Sportswoman of the Year Award at this year s Zimbabwe International Women s Awards at a colourful event at the Athena in Leicester, United Kingdom, at the weekend. She snatched the title from body-builder Helen Sinclair Costa.Last year s ZIWA Sportswoman of the Year award was won by young female motocross rider Tanya Muzinda.Kruger was the first Zimbabwean equestrian rider to compete at this year s Olympic Games, which were held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in August.The 30-year-old won the top accolade, beating other local female sporting icons such as the country s top rower Micheen Thornycroft, body-builder Sinclair Costa, Mighty Warriors midfielder Rudo Neshamba and marathon runner Rutendo Nyahora.ZIWA publicist, Shingai Mushayabasa, said the awards were an astounding success and she was impressed with the number of people who attended the event to support the excelling women. Our goal is to honour and magnify unsung heroines and to shine a light on Zimbabwean women and their successes, which have mostly been invisible within a patriarchal society. This year we had a huge support from men as compared to the past two years. And to see many people coming and celebrating the achievements of women gives them more willpower to keep on thriving for the best always. We are also creating a mentor-ship programme whereby all nominees work with Zimbabwean girls who have potential and mentor them until their talent is exceptional, Mushayabasa said.Many other women were recognised for their efforts last Saturday and those who could not attend on the day will be honoured at the second event that will be taking place in Zimbabwe.
