Nicole Hondo Correspondent&#8212;Insanity has been described in some quarters as doing the same thing over and over again and expecting the outcome to be different. The aforementioned affliction can justifiably be ascribed to organisers of recent purported mega demos in the country. From the monumental flop of the July 6, 2016 #Zimshutdown protest, to the dismal non-event that was the National Electoral Reforms Agenda (NERA) demonstration in September, and more recently, the embarrassing stillbirth that was the November 18, 2016 #MunhuWeseMuRoad protest, efforts at hoodwinking Zimbabweans into irrationally demonstrating against Government have proven futile, if not downright insane.However, despite ample evidence to this effect, self-proclaimed saviours of Zimbabwean citizens keep sprouting up like mushroom almost on a daily basis, with at times hilarious names being affixed to hastily formed organisations intended to serve the purpose of trying to entice enough people to demonstrate against Government so as to get the leaders of these pseudo-human rights organisations publicity, and, if lucky, a fast-track ticket to the US.While it would be easy to dismiss the insistence of these career protesters as mere insanity and lack of what to do, the mistake therein would be to ignore a more materialistic and arguably sinister motive driving them.While previous flopped demonstrations have been attributed to alleged police brutality and intimidation of organisers etc., it took the anti-climax that was #MunhuWeseMuRoad to let the cat out of the bag as the proverbial poo hit the fan.This writer has to admit a begrudging admiration for the preparation and publicity posters that preceded the attempted demonstration with colourful posters and at times hilarious videos and memes being circulated.Indeed, it looked like someone somewhere had put careful planning and coordination into the event and was relentlessly bombarding unfortunate Zimbabweans with invitations to the demonstration that they hoped would be the one to break the camel s back.Unfortunately for the phantom behind the initiative, the funds generated for the project proved too tempting for the various participants, and soon accusations of theft of amounts as huge as $100 000 started flying around, with insults and expletives added for dramatic effect.What pricked this writer s curiosity on November 18 was the fact that by 10am, at a time it was apparent to anyone with a brain that #MunhuWeseMuRoad was going to be a flop, one of the organisers of the said demo, Patson Dzamara, was conveniently tucked away at some private hospital in the capital, managing, despite claimed huge pain and discomfort, to pose for selfies on his hospital bed and actively cry wolf to all and sundry.All of a sudden, the excitable sections of the media, social media included, weren t interested in the flopped demo, choosing to focus on Dzamara s still-disputed abduction claims and the equally convenient disappearance of the other organisers.Interestingly, at a time when it was being reported that National Vendors Union of Zimbabwe leader Stern Zvorwadza was missing, he was busy posting selfies of himself grinning in some vehicle, hardly the stance of someone who had been abducted by the dreaded State security agents.It brought to mind the question, could Dzamara s abduction and torture claims, have been a deliberate ploy to justify his own looted money from the reported missing funds or perhaps funds he had been given to organise the demonstration?Moreso when the purported injuries to his back allegedly inflicted by the dreaded CIO amounted to a tiny scratch that needed close inspection, if not a microscope, to detect? Clad in a hospital gown with a number of people angrily denouncing his alleged abduction, it became easier for him perhaps to go back and say daddy I tried but they beat me up, if not, haa munhu wese aizara muroad. Food for thought. However, if indeed Dzamara was unfortunate enough to have been assaulted by some thugs out there then this writer wishes him a speedy recovery.It would be pertinent at this time to point out that when the #ZimShutdown flopped, the face of the protest, who is now enjoying KFC and attending NBA basketball matches in the US, Evan Mawarire, was also conveniently saved by his brief incarceration.Had he not been arrested, he might also have had a tough time justifying the funds that he was siphoning from gullible individuals under the guise of fighting the oh-so-evil Zimbabwean Government.Mawarire was lucky in that the momentum of his arrest and his sweet tongue and anguish-looking face jettisoned him to the US before his mesmerised followers could work out what was happening. Interestingly, at a time his comrades-in-arms were displaying their alleged battle wounds, which looked more like scratches made by a lady s nails, Mawarire was announcing the birth of his daughter. Never mind the trouble he created and left for his susceptible followers who now have to legally pay for their misdemeanours, Mawarire is now living it up in the States, so much for #hatichatya.What is evident in the recent chain of events is that the protest leaders are playing to the gallery as they frantically try to entice or justify receipt of funding to carry out these disruptive activities in the hopes of undermining Government.It is not in dispute that Zimbabwe is currently facing economic challenges that would understandably frustrate and even anger citizens trying to earn an honest living. It is however, highly unfair for unscrupulous persons such as Mawarire, Zvoradzwa, Patson Dzamara and Linda Masarira to take advantage of these same people to line their pockets and hopefully reach the Diaspora that they would otherwise never dream of living in.Zimbabweans being the rational and intelligent lot that they are, want and deserve genuine politicians who carry out actions intended to benefit them at large, not desperate American Green Card seekers and lazy bums who are bankrupt of ways to make an honest living.Indeed, what would one stand to gain from toyi-toying in the streets, at times dodging tear smoke or risking arrest in cases of unsanctioned demonstrations? Zvinounza sadza mumba here?Those with genuine grievances and passion for steering Zimbabwe out of the current economic hardships can always engage Government, formally or informally.Such engagement has proved more effective in this and other countries and there is no reason it should fail now.It is no wonder that a captivating debate is currently raging on who is best suited to stand for Zimbabweans rights and concerns, traditional, albeit misguided opposition politicians such as Morgan Tsvangirai or the mafikizolo protest leaders whose only tangible claim to fighting for citizens rights is the number of likes or shares on their social media pages.The jury is still out on that one.
