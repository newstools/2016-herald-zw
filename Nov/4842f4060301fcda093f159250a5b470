Dr Utete-Masang0Noah Pito in MAGUNJEDevelopment in schools can only come through innovative, diligent and focused school heads who are ready to embrace change, a senior Government official has said. Officiating at last week s ceremony to present the 2015 Secretary s Merit Award to Chisape Primary School in Magunje, Mashonaland West Province, the permanent secretary in the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education Dr Sylvia Utete-Masango said school heads are the driving force in schools and must be innovative and development-oriented.Dr Utete-Masango paid tribute to the current Chisape School head Mr Martin Ndlumbi for transforming the school s infrastructure such as teachers accommodation, classroom blocks, sporting fields, gardens and plantations into first class facilities.She said there had also been a remarkable improvement in terms of the pass rate which rose to 52 percent from 19 percent in 2013. Government always assists those that try their best. If there is development at a school, even parents will have no problem paying fees for their children as there will be enough evidence of how their money is being used, said Dr Utete-Masango.Before Mr Ndlumbi took over as head, some classrooms at Chisape School had no roofs and doors while there was an acute shortage of staff accommodation, a situation that has since changed.Chisape School, which has an enrolment of 532 pupils and 11 teachers, scooped the prestigious accolade and $5 000 prize money for development purposes ahead of 817 other primary schools in Mashonaland West province.Dr Utete-Masango urged parents to embrace the new school curriculum which she said had great respect for children s particular talents. Hurungwe district schools inspector Mr Edward Gwanzura thanked the leadership at Chisape for spearheading the school s development
