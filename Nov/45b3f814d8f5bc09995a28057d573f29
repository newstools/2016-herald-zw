Talent Gore Herald Reporter&#8212;Zimpapers handed over proceeds from its Cancer Power Walk campaign to Island Hospice in Harare on Wednesday. The Cancer Power Walk was conducted to raise awareness about cancer on November 5. Zimpapers signed a Memorandum of Understanding with Island Hospice in an effort to raise awareness about cancer.Public relations and corporate affairs manager Ms Beatrice Tonhodzayi said Zimpapers adopted the cancer cause out of realisation that there was need for awareness. Cancer has become a serious cause for concern in the country with many people dying due to different forms of cancer in recent years, she said. People are dying of cancer. While society has become a bit more conscious of cancers such as breast and cervical cancer, there are also cancers that affect men and some which affect children. There is need to speak about them too and make sure people know as much as they can about them to allow for prevention where possible as well as early diagnosis, which increases chances of survival. So as Zimpapers, through all our platforms, be it radio, newspapers, social media and digital platform, we have decided to educate people on how to prevent and manage cancer. Island Hospice financial controller Mr Elias Masendu, lauded Zimpapers for raising cancer awareness throughout the country. Zimpapers has and continues to demonstrate the functionality of private partnership through these acts of social responsibility, he said. Island Hospice thanks Zimpapers for this donation, which will go a long way in improving the quality of life for our patients and being a leader in print and digital media, it has taken a leading role in providing a platform for cancer dialogue in Zimbabwe.
