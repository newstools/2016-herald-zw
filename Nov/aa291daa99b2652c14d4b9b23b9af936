LONDON. &#8211; Antonio Conte says Diego Costa is one of the best strikers in the world after he fired Chelsea to the top of the English Premier League soccer table on Sunday. The Spaniard s 10th goal of the season helped the Blues to a 1-0 victory over Middlesbrough at the Riverside Stadium &#8211; their sixth in succession in the league without conceding and moved them ahead of Liverpool and Manchester City in the table.Costa s temperament has been questioned at times since moving to Stamford Bridge in 2014, but Conte has been delighted with the 28-year-old s attitude and told the striker to carry on doing what he is doing. For me, it s important to have this type of question because in the past, you asked me about his behaviour, about his reaction, about his patience, Conte said. Now I think he is one of the best strikers in the world and he has to continue in this way, showing his patience, but in the right way. He is very focused on the team, to help the team with the ball, without the ball and he is scoring a lot of goals. He has to continue so. The new league leaders host Tottenham on Saturday ahead of the busy Christmas programme, but Conte is prepared for what lies ahead. &#8211; Sky Sports.
