From Abel Zhakata in ChimanimaniAll is set for the Chimanimani West by-election which kicks off today at 51 centres across the constituency. Voting starts at 7am and ends at 7pm. Zimbabwe Election Commission Manicaland provincial elections officer Mr Moffat Masabeya said yesterday that everything was in place. We are ready to conduct the elections in line with the provisions of the law. All the necessary materials required for the elections have been taken to all centres in the constituency. We have enough personnel to carry out the exercise. Voting will take place in all the 11 wards in Chimanimani West where we have a total of 51 centres. Our Command Centre is situated at Nhedziwe Secondary School, he said.A visit to the command centre late yesterday afternoon showed that some people were still requesting to be accredited. Some who did not apply with electoral body to observe the election were turned down. Mr Masabeya said all those accredited to observe the elections applied to ZEC and were given the green light to do so. In the absence of that application which must be confirmed from the head office in Harare by way of an authorisation number you won t be accredited to observe the elections. This applies to everyone, he said.A survey across the constituency showed low political activity as there were no rallies. It was relatively quiet with a number of police officers deployed at all polling stations to maintain order. Zanu-PF candidate Cde Nokuthula Matsikenyere will battle it out with Mr Peter Gudyanga (Renewal Democrats of Zimbabwe), Mr Edmore Mtetwa (Independent) and Mr Pesanai Musakaruka (National Constitutional Assembly).
