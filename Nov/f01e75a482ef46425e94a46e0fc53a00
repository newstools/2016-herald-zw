AARON RUSUKIRATedious Manyepo Arts Correspondent &#8212; GOSPOETRY musician Pastor Aaron Rusukira is set to release a new-eight-track album titled Hard Talk late this month. The Mwanangu hitmaker has already released one single off the upcoming album, Mwari Vanotsvaga which is doing well on radio stations charts. The musician, popularly known as the Village Preacher in showbiz is optimistic that his upcoming album would be well-received by his fans. Music fans know me since 2010 when I released my first album, Loud Thoughts which carried the hit song, Mwanangu but I believe I have since upped my game. Back in 2010, I was still learning the ropes in the industry. I believe I have now matured enough to do music perfectly. The upcoming album will be a game-changer for me. It will touch on a number of societal values that have been relegated to the periphery and considered backward and yet they are crucial in cementing and sustaining relations, said Rusukira.The album will be his second because the 39-year-old musician released his debut album in 2010 followed by several singles. He said he decided to pass God s word through poetry, which was an easy way of reaching out to the audience. The time I decided to venture into gospel music, I saw it fit to mix poetry with music which I fuse in both Shona and English. It is something which I found worthwhile to do. I just hope this time my music will reach out to a lot of people even beyond the country s borders, he said.Of the eight tracks, Rusukira said music fans would find Usachema palatable, in terms of popularity because it was packaged in an irresistible manner .The song is an anthology of hope, highlighting the importance of staying focused even in dire situations. Other songs likely to thrill Rusukira s fans include Africa , Regai Nditaure , Dai and Upenyu .
