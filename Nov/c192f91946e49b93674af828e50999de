LONDON. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger insists no player is a mere fall-back option at the Emirates. The Gunners boss has a host of talented aces at his disposal. And he is particularly blessed with a wide array of big names in midfield, from Santi Cazorla to Granit Xhaka.Up front he has a variety of options too, with Alexis Sanchez successfully bearing the burden of firing Arsenal to glory so far this season.Last weekend Wenger was forced to call on Olivier Giroud when David Moyes Sunderland proved difficult to break down.But the veteran Frenchman says his countryman is just as important to his team s success as the often-favoured Sanchez.Speaking ahead of tomorrow s English Premier League showdown with arch-rivals Tottenham, Wenger said: There is no Plan B in any squad, I never thought about my players like that. The team who is the most effective for the next game, that s what you pick and I consider everyone as a regular player. That is basically what a manager thinks, what is (best) for the next game. If he is involved in the next game in your mind, he plays. If not then he doesn t start. He (Giroud) has shown he is a huge asset for the club and I have always supported him. The Star.
