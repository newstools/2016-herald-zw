Bipin Dani in MUMBAI, IndiaZIMBABWE opener Brian Chari wants to be known as an attacking batsman. Yesterday, the 25-year-old right handed batsman became the first Zimbabwean opener to hit a six off his first ball in a Test innings. To be honest I didn t know (that all these years no player from our country could do this) and someone had to do it. I am glad it was me, he said. Both (batsman and bowler) are responsible for this to happen. Bowler to be brave enough to toss the ball up and for the batsman to hit a big shot on the first ball especially in Test cricket. But I guess it s not something that you will be thinking about going into bat . . . Before I went in I just told myself that I want to be positive and play my game and it so happened that I got a ball that I thought I could hit for six and it was the first ball . . . And what way to reach his first fifty . . . Like I said I was looking to be positive . . . so for me it didn t matter whether I was on zero or 44 I wanted to play the ball on merit. He hit two successive boundaries (a four and a six) to reach his fifty from 40.
