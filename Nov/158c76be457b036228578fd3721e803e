JOHANNESBURG. Mike Makaab of Prosport International has clarified Nyasha Muskekwi s future and taken issue with an agent who has been speaking on behalf of the player. The 29-year-old Mushekwi, whose club season with Chinese club Dalien Yifang has recently ended, has been training with Bidvest Wits in a bid to keep fit ahead of Zimbabwe s African Nations Cup campaign in January.Football agent Ralph Nkomo indicated as much to Kick-Off yesterday but Makaab says the Zimbabwean should not be talking about Mushekwi as the striker is represented by Prosport. As Nyasha Mushekwi s official representative, I am surprised that a man of Ralph Nkomo s stature, and a person for whom I have great respect, would make comments about a footballer he does not represent and go on to discuss the future plans of Nyasha, Makaab told KickOff.com. Nyasha has a good relationship with Bidvest Wits and had a run-out at the ground to keep himself in good shape for the upcoming Afcon. The Chinese season ended a few weeks ago and only resumes next year. He is very happy at Dalian and was extremely successful in his first season. He ended up as his team s leading marksman, scoring 20 goals in 30 games, only two behind the league s leading scorer. We are looking to improve his contract at the club and hope to start negotiations with them when he returns for the new season. I suggest that Mr Nkomo reserves his comments about footballers he represents. Meanwhile, Orlando Pirates made it three wins in a row under interim coach Augusto Palacios with a 1-0 victory over struggling Chippa United in Port Elizabeth last night.Golden Boot favourite Tendai Ndoro decided matters midway through the first stanza at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium with his ninth goal in as many games this season.The result saw the Buccaneers move above arch-rivals Kaizer Chiefs to fifth on the table with 16 points from nine games &#8211; four points shy of log leaders Cape Town City.Another Warriors forward Evans Rusike scored for Maritzburg United last night but they went down 2-3 to Cape Town City at Athlone.His namesake, Matthew Rusike, suffered his second relegation in consecutive years and the third of his career this past weekend.Rusike s Swedish club Helsingborgs IF fell from the top-flight Allsvenskan to the second-tier Superettan after losing 3-2 on aggregate to Halmstads BK in the relegation play-off.Sweden s relegation play-off pits the club that finishes 14th in the top tier (Helsingborgs) against the team that ends up third (Halmstads) in the second tier.Ironically, Halmstads is the team Rusike played for when they were relegated from top-flight football last year, after which he joined Helsingborgs.Rusike was previously relegated while with Jomo Cosmos during the 2011/12 season.This means the burly forward has now been demoted with three clubs during a career that has also seen him win the Absa Premiership title with Kaizer Chiefs, whom he joined after leaving Cosmos.The 26-year-old only joined Helsingborgs at the beginning of the year and though he played regularly with 25 league appearances, he scored just three goals.- Kick-Off
