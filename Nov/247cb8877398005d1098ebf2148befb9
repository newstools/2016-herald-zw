Freeman Razemba in Zezani, BeitbridgeOVER 100 livestock have been stolen this year in 31 stocktheft cases recorded in Zezani, Beitbridge, as police continue to intensify their campaign to educate people on the need to brand their livestock ahead of the December 2017 deadline. According to police statistics, of the 101 livestock stolen between January and October, 69 were cattle, 10 goats and 10 donkeys.During the same period last year, 40 cases were recorded.Addressing farmers, businesspeople, councillors and senior police officers here yesterday, Deputy Anti-Stock Theft National Coordinator Assistant Commissioner Panganai Sande said police recovered 44 livestock in the area.He said of the 44 recovered, 34 were cattle, 10 goats and 10 donkeys. Zezani has a total of 1 756 cattle. We will, however, continue to educate people who own cattle on the need to brand them. Most of the cattle that are being stolen do not have brand marks, he said.He said anyone who sought to move or kill cattle should first seek clearance from the police.Asst Comm Sande urged cattle owners to join the Village Anti-Stock Theft Committees and the business community to become members of the Business Against Stocktheft Forum to curb stock- theft activities.He said farmers whose areas do not have grazing areas as a result of the drought should find ways to buy stockfeed for their cattle. You (farmers) can either sell one or two of their livestock so that you will get money to buy stockfeeds for the remaining cattle, Asst Comm Sande said.During the meeting, some of the farmers complained that most of the cattle rustlers that were arrested by police, would be given lenient sentences by the courts and would come back to steal more cattle in the area.National Anti-Stocktheft coordinator Senior Assistant Commissioner Erasmus Makodza said they were lobbying Government to ensure that such criminals would get deterrent sentences ranging between 30 and 50 years for stealing one beast.He assured farmers that the police would put in place adequate measures to ensure that the national herd was protected.Snr Asst Comm Makodza reiterated that any police officer caught conniving with cattle rustlers would be dismissed from the force.
