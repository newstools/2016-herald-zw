Elita Chikwati Agriculture ReporterFarmers have planted more than 14 000 hectares of tobacco as production of the crop continues to rise. This is an increase from the 12 888 hectares that were planted during the same period last week. Tobacco Industry and Marketing Board (TIMB) statistics indicate that during the same period last year, farmers had not started planting the dryland crop due to delayed rains.This season farmers have so far planted 2 079 hectares under dryland.The statistics show that Mashonaland East topsg the list having planted 7 724 hectares with 5 655 hectares planted under irrigation while 2 069 have been planted under dryland.Farmers in Mashonaland West have planted 3 080 hectares under irrigation and 10 hectares under dryland.Mashonaland and Manicaland have planted 1 711 hectares and 1 340 hectares, respectively.Midlands farmers have planted 176 hectares.Zimbabwe Commercial Farmers Union (ZCFU) president Mr Wonder Chabikwa said tobacco planting was progressing well and farmers were better in terms of preparedness.He said most farmers had bought inputs during the marketing season while others were contracted. Most tobacco growers are contracted and they have access to inputs. There has been an improvement in electricity supply and this has also made it easier for farmers to irrigate their crop, said Mr Chabikwa.Tobacco production has been on the increase due to the lucrative prices and organised market.Government has on several occasions applauded tobacco farmers for their resilience even under harsh weather conditions.Last year Zimbabwe experienced a drought that affected production of other crops but tobacco growers produced 202 million kilogrammes of the crop worth $596 million.Tobacco injects foreign currency into the economy during the tobacco marketing season with close to a billion United States dollars having been available to buy the crop produced during the 2015-16 season.In 2008 only 48 million kilogrammes of tobacco were produced, but production significantly rose to 216 million kilogrammes by the end of 2014 season.
