STOKE-ON-TRENT. Ivory Coast striker Wilfried Bony ended a 10-month goal drought with a brace against former club Swansea City as Stoke City s revival continued with a 3-1 win in Monday night s English Premier League soccer clash. Both goals for the 27-year-old Manchester City loanee were set up by another former Swansea favourite, Joe Allen, with Alfie Mawson also putting through his own net as Stoke claimed a third win on the bounce. It is crazy that my first goals come against my ex-team, it is disappointing for them but that is how football happens, Bony told Sky Sports. I have missed some chances but I knew the goals would come. Every game I push myself. Swansea, who had levelled in the first half through Wayne Routledge, have made their worst start to a Premier League season with just five points from 10 matches. It is also the first time they have gone nine games without a win. There is no easy solution to getting confidence back, Swansea manager Bob Bradley told Sky Sports. AFP.
