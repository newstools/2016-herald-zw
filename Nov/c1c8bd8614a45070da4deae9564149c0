CHICAGO. New Zealand rugby coach Steve Hansen refused to blame the All Blacks injury crisis after his side crashed to a stunning first ever defeat to Ireland. The New Zealanders had gone into Saturday s game with locks Brodie Retallick, Sam Whitelock and Luke Romano all unavailable, a weakness that Ireland exploited mercilessly on their way to a historic 40-29 win at Soldier Field. People will say Ah, but you didn t have your two locks, Hansen said. But we haven t got any excuses &#8212; we just got beaten by a better side on the day. And that happens when you play good sides. We ve been saying for quite some time that Ireland are a good team. All Black skipper Kieran Read said the New Zealanders, who only last month had won a record 18th consecutive game, had been unable to summon the right mental approach. We just didn t come out with the right attitude, Read said. We allowed Ireland to be dominant in that first half. There s a few lessons we ve got to learn. They came out with a lot of emotion and played very smartly and won a lot of the loose ball. We just weren t able to get into the game. They came out and beat us in the key areas. AFP&nbsp;&nbsp;
