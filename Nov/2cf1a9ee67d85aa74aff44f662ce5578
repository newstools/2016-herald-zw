ADELAIDE. Australia cruised to a seven-wicket consolation victory in the day-night third Test cricket yesterday after dismissing South Africa for 250 and knocking off the 127 runs for victory for the loss of three wickets before dinner on day four. There was a minor scare when, with 63 runs still required, Dave Warner was run-out for 47 and Usman Khawaja dismissed for a duck inside one over but there was never any real doubt that Australia would avoid a first ever 3-0 sweep on home soil.Opener Matt Renshaw, one of three new caps brought into the Australia side after heavy defeats in the first two Tests, scored 34 not out and brought the hosts level after his captain Steve Smith was dismissed for 40 with only two runs required.
