MONTEVIDEO. - Lionel Messi produced a magical display to get Argentina s World Cup soccer qualification back on track on Tuesday as Brazil notched their sixth consecutive victory to put one foot in the 2018 finals in Russia. He curled home a stunning 30-yard free-kick and set up goals for Lucas Pratto and Angel Di Maria in a 3-0 win over Colombia in San Juan. The victory elevated Argentina into the qualifying places after a disastrous run of results which saw them take just two points from their previous four games. But the feel-good factor generated by the result was overshadowed by a media boycott imposed by a furious Messi and his Argentina team-mates after the final whistle. Messi said the Albiceleste s players were incensed by a claim made by an Argentine journalist that forward Ezequiel Lavezzi had been caught smoking marijuana in the camp.Lavezzi has angrily denied the claims. Tuesday s win left Argentina in fifth spot in the 10-team standings, with 19 points from 12 games. The top four sides qualify automatically for the 2018 finals while the fifth-placed team goes into a play-off with the first-placed team from the Oceania zone. &#8211; AFP.
