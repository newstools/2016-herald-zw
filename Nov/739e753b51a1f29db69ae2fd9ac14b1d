Tinashe Makichi recently in Chiredzi The construction of the $300 million Tokwe-Mukosi Dam is expected to be completed before the end of the year. The dam s construction, wholly funded by Government is being built at the confluence of Tokwe and Mukosi rivers in Chivi district, Masvingo. Upon completion, Tokwe-Mukosi Dam will become Zimbabwe s largest inland dam with an 89,2 metre high dam wall. The purpose of the dam is to provide irrigation water to the Lowveld sugar estates and surrounding communal farmers. Tokwe-Mukosi Dam also has potential to generate 15 megawatts electricity. It is estimated that setting up a mini-hydro power station at the dam will cost $40 million. There are still some outstanding works to be done at the dam but we are quite confident that all critical works will be completed by the end of this year, said the Zimbabwe National Water Authority (ZINWA).Recent additional intervention by Government, through the Infrastructure Development Bank, IDBZ, has been a timely shot in the arm and the contractor, Italian company Salini-Impregilo, is fully mobilised to substantially complete the Dam by end December 2016. Government recently released $20,3 million to finance the outstanding works.Speaking after a tour of the project site last week, IDBZ chief executive Thomas Zondo Sakala, said the dam was a landmark project. He said the project demonstrates Government s commitment towards the transformation of the economy . As IDBZ we are pleased to have been a part of a project that is not only strategic to the nation but will contribute towards sustainably transforming the lives of many other in the communities around it, said Mr Sakala.He went on to highlight that the bank has also gained valuable experience which will be useful in planning and implementing similar projects in the future. Meanwhile, the IDBZ is making urgent efforts to raise $7 million to fund the excavation works for the proposed mini-hydro power station.
