The birthday bash is for celebrating with my fans in the country and they should come to see me in action and support the show, Mangwenya said. I want to always give my fans the best, I saw it fit to go out there and get the necessary exposure, thereby continuing to learn from other artistes and get more experience. My UK tour will be a learning experience, she said. I also want to keep raising the Zimbabwean flag high as other artistes do when they go out and be a good ambassador of the country. She said a lot of people have been requesting for her yesteryear music which also prompted her to embark on tours. I am forced to revisit the archives because of overwhelming requests for old songs, she said. I also have many new fans who got to know me through my latest album and tours and I continually want to make them happy, she added.Mangwenya said she is going abroad to learn from other artistes who come from different backgrounds and cultures.
