Some parts of the country have started receiving rains as the 2016/17 rain seasons gets into full swing. The rains will undoubtedly come as a huge relief to farmers and many other people in urban areas where the effects of the current drought has seen local authorities adopting water demand management mechanisms as they grappled with the limited available water in their water supply dams. Under such circumstances rains will bring the much needed relief for users. However, while the rains have started falling, it must not be lost on us that the drought is still with us.The rains that fell have not changed much, if anything people should continue to practice serious water efficiency.The need to conserve water is still very important and people should not take comfort of the rains at this stage and relax.ZINWA continues to implore water users to remain very mindful of the fact that the effects of the rains will not be felt now.Dams are still critically low, rivers have not yet started flowing and groundwater levels remain depressed.The situation has not yet improved and it is how we conserve the little we have that will determine our destiny.We, however, can still do something to ease our situation as the rains are falling. It is imperative that water users embrace rain water harvesting technology and practices.Rain water harvesting can be a very crucial mechanism towards mitigating the impact of the current drought.Rain water harvesting is the process of collecting water from suitable surfaces on which rain falls and preserving it for future use. Normally, rainwater is collected from roof tops and stored in water tanks.The water can also be harnessed from ground water sources to constructed reservoirs and it is important to note that this rainwater harvesting concept can be practiced in towns, cities, farms and rural areas.Although the rainwater harvesting concept is fairly new in Zimbabwe, it has been around for a long time and has also been rapidly growing in other parts of the African continent. The claim that rainwater harvesting is only possible when the rains are heavy is unfortunately one of the biggest misconceptions that have scuttled rainwater harvesting efforts in the past.Can be used for severalnon-drinking purposesHarvested rainwater can be used for several non-drinking functions such as flushing toilets, washing clothes, watering the garden etc.In a country that is experiencing water shortage, it is unnecessary to use treated water for non-drinking household chores when the same chores can be done using harvested rainwater.Reduces water billSince water collected through water harvesting can be used for several non-drinking functions both at home and in businesses, this leads to a reduction in utilities bills. In industries, harvested water can be used in many operations without having to rely on and therefore deplete conventional sources.Reduces demand on groundwaterDue to industrial development and rapid population growth, water supply especially in most urban areas has outstripped supply with many people having to rely on groundwater for their water needs which has led to the depletion of groundwater level. If the little rain that we are receiving is harvested, it would reduce demand on groundwater as more people will be using the harvested water for all non-drinking chores.Suitable for irrigationRainwater is free from many chemicals found in groundwater and that makes it arguably the most suitable for irrigation.For more information you can contact the ZINWA Corporate Communications and Marketing Department on pr@zinwa.co.zw or visit www.zinwa.co.zw.
