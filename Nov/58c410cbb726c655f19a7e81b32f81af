LONDON. The highest law court in Britain, the Supreme Court, announced on Tuesday that the crucial Brexit hearing will start on December 5 in London and last four days. Officials set the timetable after confirming that the court had now received a formal notification of the British government s intention to appeal last Thursday s decision in the High Court over the triggering of Britain s exit process from the European Union.The High Court ruled that British Prime Minister Theresa May s government cannot use a royal prerogative to trigger the so-called Article 50 mechanism that starts the Brexit process. The three judges instead said the parliament had to be involved in the process.An official at the Supreme Court said the permission for the government appeal has been granted by a panel of three justices, Lord Neuberger, Lord Mance and Lord Kerr, and the case can now proceed to a full hearing.It also emerged Tuesday that the regional government of Scotland will seek to oppose the British government in the Supreme Court.Scotland s most senior law officer, Lord Advocate, is to apply to be heard in the case. In the June 23 referendum, the majority of people in Scotland voted to remain in the EU, but the overall vote across Britain was in favour of leaving by a 52-to-48 margin.A spokesman at the Supreme Court in London said four days, December 5 to 8, have been earmarked for the appeal hearing.Prime Minister May has already said she still aims to stick with her timetable to trigger Article 50 by the end of next March.
