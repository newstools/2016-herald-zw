Collin Matiza Sports Editor&#8212;ONE of Zimbabwe s top squash players Ishmael Mubure was on Sunday walking on cloud nine after he won his first major title of the year in Europe at the Keep Fit Open tournament at Wevelgem in Belgium. Mubure, who is now a professional squash player and based in the Netherlands, fought his way to the final of the Keep Fit Open tournament where he did himself and the nation proud by beating Gregory Lecerf of Belgium 3-0 (13-11, 11-4, 11-7) to collect a winner s cheque for 750 Euros and a floating trophy.Speaking to The Herald yesterday from Wevelgem following his triumph on Sunday, Mubure (30) said his sweet victory in the Belgian tournament meant a lot to him as it will help him to get a world ranking after having been sidelined for a year by a knee injury. I must say it was a great feeling winning the tournament because it was my first title in 2016 so it really means a lot to me. I don t have a world ranking at the moment because I had stopped playing in the PSA (Professional Squash Association) last year when I was struggling with a knee injury but I m going to start playing again in more professional tournaments around Europe next year, said Mubure, who recently tied the knot with his Dutch sweetheart , Wendy Visch.Mubure has been based in the Netherlands for six years now.On his way to the final, Mubure, who stays in Apeldoorn in the Netherlands, first played another top Belgian player Maarten Meerschaert and he beat him 3-0 (11-1,11-4,11-8) to move into the last eight where he met Jonas Snoeck, winning the match by the same scoreline (3-0) (11-7,12-10,13-11).In the semi-finals Mubure had a very long and tough match against the No.1 seed Lowie Delbeke of Belgium who he managed to beat 3-2 (9-11,10-12,11-9,11-7,11-5) to march into the final where he met another top Belgian player Lecerf.And in the final, the Zimbabwean player was in an uncompromising mood as he convincingly beat Lecerf in straight sets 13-11,11-4,11-7 to walk away with the 2016 Keep Fit Open title and won the hearts of Belgian squash fans who watched this match.Lecerf had beaten Kristof Van Der Heggen in the semi-finals 3-0 (11-4,11-5,11-7).Third place went to Delbeke who won 3-0 against Van Der Heggen (11-9,11-8,11-9).In the women s final, Yara Delagrange beat fellow Belgian player Anouk Feys 3-0 (11-6,11-3,11-8) to emulate Zimbabwe s Mubure who clinched the men s title.Mubure, who is the only Zimbabwean currently playing professional squash in Europe, is a product of Belgravia Sports Club in Harare where he was at one stage coached by one of the country s top squash coaches Mashumba Mukumba who is now running an academy Zimbabwe Squash Academy Trust at the same sports club.And Mukumba yesterday saluted Mubure for winning the Keep Fit Open title in Belgium. Ishmael Mubure s victory in Belgium on Sunday is an encouragement to our kids at the academy. He is an inspiration to our kids who always play with a focus of getting to his level or even higher because Ishmael started playing squash at the age of 18 and our kids started earlier than him which means they can do much better than him. Most of our children at the academy have an ambition to go overseas and this can only be fulfilled by playing squash regularly. Squash, as a sport, gives life to our children and he (Mubure) has indicated that he will always be there to help them in fulfilling their dreams of playing the sport professionally overseas, said Mukumba whose Zimbabwe Squash Academy Trust will be celebrating their seventh anniversary by holding a tournament on November 25 and 26.The SEF Prospero Capital (PVT) Limited-sponsored tournament will see some of the country s top junior male and female players fighting for the top honours in the Under-11, 14, 16, 19 and 23 age-groups at Belgravia Sports Club.Apart from SEF Prospero Capital (Pvt) Limited, this junior tournament, which is also open to senior female players, will also be bankrolled by FedEx Express, St Elmos and Duskhome who will be providing goodies for the players at the two-day event.
