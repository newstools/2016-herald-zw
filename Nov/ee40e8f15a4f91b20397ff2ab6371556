Zvamaida Murwira: Senior ReporterPresident Mugabe is set to deliver a State of the Nation address next Thursday in which he will address Parliament on the country s achievements and priorities over the next year. The yearly event serves as a platform for the President to inform the nation about the country s current and socio-economic and political situation. Clerk of Parliament Mr Kennedy Chokuda, confirmed the development on Thursday. Yes, I can confirm that His Excellency, the President, will address a joint sitting of both the National Assembly and Senate, where he will deliver a State of the Nation Address on December 1 2016. We have since started making preparations for the event and obviously look forward to it, said Mr Chokuda.In his address, the Head of State and Government and Commander-in-Chief of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces, is expected to update Parliament on national developments, challenges and how Government intends to overcome them.Key among them is the introduction of bond notes aimed at stimulating export-led industrialisation through the provision of a 5 percent incentive scheme for exporters. Another objective of the bond notes would be to curb the foreign currency leakages as well as arrest the current cash challenges.The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe Amendment Bill, which seeks to give legal effect to the bond notes, is already before Parliament. The President is also expected to give an update on the Command Agriculture programme, where Government is providing inputs for farmers to improve crop yields, and food security.At least 19 600 farmers have received inputs under the Government specialised scheme, with about 163 865 hectares of both irrigable and dry land now under contract farming. President Mugabe is also expected to touch on other aspects aimed at implementing Government s economic blue-print, Zim-Asset.The event is expected to be attended by captains of industry, diplomats accredited to Zimbabwe and senior Government officials.
