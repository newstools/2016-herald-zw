First place in the girls Under-11 age-group went to Berth Moore Gordon who beat Lana O Donovan and Delight Nyakabawu into second and third place respectively while Daniel Bezuidenhout clinched the boys Under-14 title ahead of Mahmoud Elbick and Muzuva Gutu.There were also some tears of joy for young Taine Turnock who walked away with the boys Under-16 title, beating Harry Lawton and Aiden Martin into second and third place.Mashumba Mukumba, the director and founder of the Zimbabwe Squash Academy Trust, yesterday described their 7th anniversary tournament as a resounding success after it attracted a large number of participants including some from South Africa. The South African boys arrived a day before the tournament and they really enjoyed playing in the tournament and they also enjoyed their (brief) stay in Zimbabwe. One of the two South African boys Sylvestor Mabote (20) and is currently the number 3 seed at his Soweto-based squash club Egoli and his teammate Wesley Ngwenya, who is also 20 and, is the number 7 seed there and they both played in the Under-23 category. Mabote managed to finish fourth overall but Ngwenya found the going tough against some of our top players and failed to make it into the top five. However, both the boys from South Africa, who left immediately after the tournament, indicated that they really enjoyed playing in this event in which they gained some invaluable experience, Mashumba Mukumba said.He said that it was also good seeing some local children showcasing their talents. This tournament has grown exceptionally big to such an extent that it was like we were having the main Zimbabwe Open tournament. Children from Bulawayo s Falcon Collge were also present and they enjoyed the tournament too. I would also like to say a big thank to our sponsors SEF Prospero Capital (Private) Ltd, FedEx Express, Duskhome and St Elmos; and not forgetting my partners in organising this tournament, Malvin Mubure, Talent Mushunje, Mike Lawton and Leigh-Anne Davis for contributing in a big way and making the tournament a huge success, Mashumba Mukumba said.
