A speechwriter for Donald Trump&#8217;s business later took the blame.President Obama and Trump met alone in the Oval Office for 90 minutes on Thursday. Obama said he wanted to make Trump and his family &#8220;feel welcome as we prepare to make this transition.&#8221;For his part, Trump said he looked forward to working with Obama in the future.&#8220;Mr. President, it was a great honor being with you, and I look forward being with you many, many more times,&#8221; Trump said.President Obama has pledged that he and his team would work to ensure a peaceful transition of power after a bitter campaign and long history with the president-elect. Trump was a central figure in the creation of the &#8220;birther&#8221; movement, spending years questioning Obama&#8217;s place of birth and thus his legitimacy to be president. NBC News
