 Douglas ChimbetuTawanda Marwizi Arts Correspondent&#8212;Musician Douglas Chimbetu has come under fire for failing to perform in Mazowe over the weekend despite having been paid. Venue owner Emmanuel Timothy who availed the contract and proof of payment to this publication said he would engage the police to recover his money from the musician. He said they have been trying to get in touch with him since Saturday but he was not available. We gave him a deposit but he failed to come. We are taking the legal route, he said.Timothy said he was on his way to the police to make a report. We have been trying to get in touch with him but he is nowhere to be found so we have decided to engage the police over the matter, he said.Apart from the deposit he paid the musician, Timothy said he wanted back the money he used on posters and other expenses. This is the time to show musicians that we are strictly in business. He will be an example to other artistes who are failing to fulfil performing contracts, he said.Sungura musician Herbert Majeke came to the rescue as fans were becoming impatient. Majeke did well as he came and performed. He was forced to do some Simon Chimbetu songs to cover up for his fellow artiste, he said.Majeke had no kind words for the young Dendera crooner. He was given money to bring the PA system but he never came for the show. He even got a deposit but he didn t bother to communicate, he said.Majeke said they had to travel back to the capital just before midnight to get a makeshift PA system. That was very unprofessional for a musician like him. That is not acceptable because it tarnishes our image as musicians, said Majeke.Efforts to get a comment from Chimbetu were fruitless as his four mobile phones were not reachable.A band member from his camp said they knew of the show but the musician decided to cancel it. We knew about the show but we were told later that it had been cancelled, he said.
