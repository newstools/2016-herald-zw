The Zimbabwe National Water Authority has started rolling out a programme to resuscitate around 1 200 boreholes around the country. Under the exercise, ZINWA will resuscitate one borehole per ward across the country. The programme is part of ZINWA drought mitigation efforts as the country battles its worst drought in 25 years. Rural communities will benefit most from this programme as the majority of the country s wards are in rural areas. This exercise is, no doubt, a huge step towards improving people s access to water.Under the programme, boreholes that would have dried up after their breakdown or malfunction will be deepened to enhance their capacity.This move will not only benefit people, but livestock. In areas such as Bikita, Kotwa and other areas hard hit by the drought, people now drive their livestock for kilometres to water the animals but with the rehabilitation programme, the boreholes can be used to provide water for livestock as well.In addition, the time people in those communities spent looking for water would also be significantly reduced allowing them to devote their energies to other productive endeavours.This will certainly bring relief to women and girls who bear the worst brunt in times of water shortages as they are forced to spend long hours walking to get water or waiting in queues at water points. Research has pointed to a significant number of girls being forced out of school to help with fetching for water in many Sub-Saharan Africa countries.While the programme may not be adequate, it is a welcome step that heralds more efforts to come. However, while ZINWA and other players in the water sector are putting their best foot forward in the quest to mitigate the drought, it must not be lost on people, especially those to benefit from the drought response interventions and those in areas currently water secure that the responsibility to save water is still there.Water is a finite and strategic resource that needs to be looked after well. ZINWA, being the Government s water resources management lead agency continues to emphasise the need for water efficiency across all the sectors.Water users should continue to use the resource quite sparingly, mindful of its fragile nature and the need to have water for future needs and future generations. The Authority continues to implore users in households and the farms to ensure water is efficiently utilised. Water losses at any stage of use should be avoided as much as possible.HouseholdsIn the households, users should strive to:Practice water recycling and reuseUse buckets when bathing, instead of the showerBrushing teeth using water from a glass, cup or tumbler as opposed to using a running tapRepair all leaking taps and toilet cisternsUsing buckets when washing cars and watering gardensGrowing drought resistant flowers and lawnsFarmsFarmers can also save water by:Lining their water conveyance canals to reduce water lossesRepairing all leaks along the irrigation systemsUnderstanding their crop water requirements at different stages of maturityDesisting from irrigating when it is windyIrrigating early in the mornings or later afternoons to reduce water loss through evaporationWhere farmers are contemplating to venture into irrigation, they should consider water efficient irrigation systems such as drip irrigation.By conserving water, users ensure that the limited water available can be stretched further than it would have ordinarily covered with normal use.It is everyone s responsibility to conserve water. Water users should also pay their bills to have uninterrupted and guaranteed service.&nbsp;For more information please contact the ZINWA Corporate Communications and Marketing Department on pr@zinwa.co.zw or alternatively like the Zimbabwe National Water Authority Facebook Page.
