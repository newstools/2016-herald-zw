Margaret Matibiri: Herald ReporterA Waterfalls motorist who slapped a motorcyclist for recklessly riding his bike is now facing murder charges following the death of the cyclist who crashed his head onto the tarmac following the attack. In a fit of road rage, Prosper Marozva (27) followed and blocked Edward Chitute and attacked him for allegedly encroaching onto his lane, forcing him to brake sud- denly. Marozva appeared in court last week and was represented by his lawyer Mr Patrick Mashiri, while the State was led by prosecutor Mr Sebastian Mutizirwa. Harare magistrate Ms Bianca Makwande remanded Marozva in custody to November 17 and advised him to apply for bail at the High Court.His lawyer did not oppose his placement on remand. Allegations are that on September 26 at around 10am along Nothhampton Crescent, Eastlea, Marozva was driving a Nissan Caravan in hot pursuit of the now deceased Chitute.Marozva caught up with Chitate and accused him of reckless driving, forcing him to brake suddenly, the court heard. It is alleged that Chitute, who was still on his motorbike removed his crash helmet, while Marozva disembarked from his car. He slapped Chitute once in the face, causing him to fall hard on the tarmac.The court heard that Matute sustained serious head injuries causing intracranial bleeding (bleeding that occurs inside the skull). Chitute was referred to Panacea Hospital then further conveyed to the Avenues Clinic where he died on October 2.
