Crime ReporterPolice have expressed concern with the surge in rape cases countrywide and urged parents to look after minors who are often the victims of sexual assault. In a statement yesterday, chief police spokesperson Senior Assistant Commissioner Charity Charamba said they were investigating several cases of rape recorded countrywide last week. Some of the perpetrators of the offence are so callous to the extent that in one such case in Macheke, Mashonaland East, a 23-year-old man raped a six-year-old girl who was sleeping in a room around midnight, she said.She said in another case which occurred in Seke, a 43-year-old man raped a 16-year-old mentally challenged girl whom he had found alone at home. In some instances, females are being duped by their male relatives or boyfriends into accompanying them to secluded places whey they end up being raped.Some juveniles are left in the custody of relatives who violate the trust bestowed upon them by abusing them, said Snr Asst Comm Charamba.She urged parents and guardians to ensure the safety of their children by leaving them in the custody of trustworthy relatives.Snr Asst Comm Charamba said young girls were discouraged from accompanying strangers and boyfriends to secluded places as this would expose them to abuse. Children should also be accompanied by adults or other pupils when going to and coming back from school, she said.Vice President Phelekezela Mphoko last week said Government was working on legislation to provide mandatory sentencing for rape and sexual abuse after Cabinet unanimously agreed that there was need for stiffer sentences like life in prison for perpetrators.Speaking at the commemoration of the International Day of the Girl Child and the launch of the national HeForShe Campaign, VP Mphoko said the country was experiencing intolerable levels of violence against women and girls. I am informed that the Attorney-General s Office is already working on legislation to provide for mandatory sentencing for rape and sexual abuse.As Cabinet, we unanimously agreed that we need these stiffer sentences such as sentencing perpetrators to life in prison. I urge the Ministry of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs to expedite passage of the bill through Parliament. Another equally disturbing phenomenon is the issue of child marriage, where girls as young as six years are married off, he said.
