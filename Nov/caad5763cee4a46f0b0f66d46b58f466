BATTLING ON . . . Zimbabwe all-rounder Sean Williams slaps one through the off side during his half century on the third day of the second Test against Sri Lanka at Harare Sports Club yesterday. AFPGOOD bowling and smart catching in the afternoon helped to make up for Zimbabwe s disappointing first-innings batting during the morning of day three of the second Test against Sri Lanka at Harare Sports Club. Faced with a total of over 500, at least one big century was needed, but there was no man for this occasion, and there were some rather feeble dismissals as Zimbabwe subsided to 272 all out.But then, led by Carl Mumba, with three wickets, the Zimbabwe bowlers, generally well supported in the field, struck back when Sri Lanka batted again, and took four wickets for 102 runs by the close.In the morning Zimbabwe resumed at their overnight score of 126 for two, still 378 runs behind, with both Brian Chari and Craig Ervine on 60.The weather was again hot and sunny, but the pitch was beginning to show signs of wear.Ervine, so imperious and dominating on the previous evening, did not look the same player this morning, as he was unable to break the shackles of fine bowling.After more than 20 minutes seven runs had been accumulated and scarcely a shot had been played in anger, and at this point the Decision Review System saved Zimbabwe from another erroneous decision.Ervine, probably frustrated, unwisely attempted a reverse sweep against Herath, and the ball bounced up to be caught at short leg.Umpire Ian Gould raised his finger but, after a long delay, the DRS showed the ball had come off his arm guard.However, Ervine did not live to enjoy the reprieve without addition to his 64, he ran a single for Chari and then, only half-forward, edged a swinging ball from Lakmal into the slips; 134 for three.When Chari reached 80 he groped down the wrong line to a ball from Herath, and was bowled through the gate between bat and pad. He faced 158 balls and hit two sixes and nine fours; 173 for four.Malcolm Waller made a confident start, scoring six runs with two fine strokes in his first four balls.He and Sean Williams continued to bat positively against the spinners Herath and Dilruwan Perera, bowling in harness.The 200 came up just before lunch, but then Waller checked a drive off Herath and was caught low down at cover. It was a crucial wicket at a crucial time.The lunchtime score therefore was 210 for five, with Williams looking good on 40 and Peter Moor to come in. Williams reached his fifty off 80 balls with a ramp over the slips off a fast ball from Lahiru Kumara.Finally it was time for Sri Lanka to benefit from the DRS: Williams, on 58, missed a sweep at a straight ball from Perera, and the referral overruled umpire Gould s not-out decision.He hit eight fours and faced 93 balls, and Zimbabwe were now 253 for six, just over half the Sri Lanka total; the partnership added 43.Herath with five for 89 was the best of the bowlers, while Perera took three wickets and Lakmal two.ScoresSri Lanka 504 and 102 for 4 in 40 overs (Dimuth Karunaratne 54*, Upul Tharanga 17; Carl Mumba 3/31, Graeme Cremer 1/21)Zimbabwe 272 all out in 82.1 overs (Brian Chari 80, Craig Ervine 64, Sean Williams 58; Rangana Herath 5/89, Dilruwan Perera 3/51, Suranga Lakmal 2/55)Stumps Day 3: Sri Lanka lead by 334 runs with six wickets remaining Zimcricket
