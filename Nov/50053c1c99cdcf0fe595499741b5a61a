LONDON. Yaya Tour has apologised to Manchester City for the misunderstandings from the past as the midfielder attempts to resurrect his career at the Etihad Stadium. Tour has been frozen out by Pep Guardiola after comments from his agent Dimitri Seluk criticising the manager after the midfielder was omitted from City s Champions League squad.The former Ivory Coast international, who played for Guardiola at Barcelona before being sold to City in 2010, has yet to feature for the club in the English Premier League this soccer season, with his only appearance coming in the Champions League qualifier against Steaua Bucharest.That led the outspoken Seluk to criticise Guardiola, questioning whether he had the b***s to say that he was wrong to humiliate a great player like Yaya should City not win the Champions League. Guardiola then insisted Tour would not play for him again unless Seluk apologised for his comments and yesterday morning, the four-time African Player of the Year moved to make peace with a statement on his website. I wish to apologise on behalf of myself and those who represent me to the management team and all those working at the club for the misunderstandings from the past, read the statement. Sky Sports.
