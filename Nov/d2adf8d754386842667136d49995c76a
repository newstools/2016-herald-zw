VISAKHAPATNAM. &#8211; Ravichandran Ashwin finished with a match haul of eight wickets as England collapsed on the last day of the second Test cricket to hand India a thumping 246-run win and a series lead yesterday. Chasing an unlikely 405 for victory, England were bowled out 20 minutes after lunch for 158 as India grabbed a 1-0 lead in the five-match series, after the first Test was drawn.The victory was India s second biggest against England by runs, after they won by 279 runs at Leeds 30 years ago. Ashwin, the leading Test wicket-taker this year, once again turned on the heat against the English batsmen who resumed their chase at 87 for two but lost their last eight wickets for just 71 runs.The off-spinner, who picked up his 22nd five-wicket haul in first innings, captured the first scalp of the day by having Ben Duckett caught behind for nought, ending the batsman s brief, 16-ball stay at the crease.Ashwin and debutant Jayant Yadav took three wickets each in England s second innings, while fast bowler Mohammed Shami chipped in with two. &#8211; AFP.
