JOHANNESBURG. &#8211; Coach-less South Africa stretched an unbeaten record to 14 matches on Tuesday night by drawing 1-1 away to Mozambique in an international friendly soccer match. Clesio Bauque gave the Mambas a first-half lead in Maputo that was cancelled by Bafana Bafana substitute Bradley Grobler early in the second half. Mozambique captain Elias Pelembe and South Africa defender Clayton Daniels were foiled by the woodwork in the closing stages of a fast-paced match.South Africa coach Ephraim Shakes Mashaba was suspended two days ago for insulting national association president Danny Jordaan after a World Cup qualifying win over Senegal. Jordaan had been critical of the coach recently when South Africa failed to reach the 2017 African Cup of Nations in Gabon.Mashaba will face a disciplinary hearing and some in the South African media speculated that he could be fired this week with former Dutch star Ruud Krol a possible replacement. &#8211; AFP.
