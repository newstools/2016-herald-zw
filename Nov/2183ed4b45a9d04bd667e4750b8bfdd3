LONDON. &#8211; Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp faces an anxious wait to discover the extent of the injury Adam Lallana suffered playing for England. The 28-year-old limped off after 25 minutes of England s 2-2 draw with Spain at Wembley on Tuesday night. Liverpool travel to Southampton on Saturday to play Lallana s former club in the English Premier League. Lallana has been in impressive form of late and scored England s opening goal from the penalty spot, after Jamie Vardy had been pulled down when latching on to a through pass from the Liverpool midfielder. But 15 minutes later Lallana went down under a challenge from Thiago Alcantara and was unable to continue. Vardy scored a second for England just after the break, but two late goals from Iago Aspas and Isco earned Spain a draw.Lallana has scored six times for club and country in 15 appearances this season. - Sky Sports.
