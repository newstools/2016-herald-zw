From George Maponga in BIKITAHundreds of villagers in Bikita West have been thrown a lifeline after the zanu-pf aspiring National Assembly Member for the constituency Cde Beauty Chabaya, sourced 60 tonnes of maize and rice for them. Distribution of the rice and maize is expected to be done by traditional leaders and councillors across the constituency. Among villagers set to benefit from the food donated by Cde Chabaya are those from Mukanganwi, Marozva and Mazungunye communal lands, which were some of the hardest-hit by drought in the last agricultural season. Cde Chabaya won zanu-pf primary elections to represent the ruling party in the looming by-election to fill a vacancy left by the jailed Munyaradzi Kereke.Kereke was sent to jail for an effective 10 years for raping his niece and had been legislator for Bikita West since 2013 when he was elected on a zanu-pf ticket. Cde Chabaya yesterday revealed that distribution of the rice and maize she sourced was expected to kick-off this week. After realising that hunger was one of the major challenges afflicting Bikita West, I managed to mobilise 30 tonnes of maize and an equal amount of rice that will be distributed by traditional leaders and councillors across the constituency, she said. There is severe food shortage in Bikita West and the entire district and we will continue to source more food so that more of our people benefit, added Cde Chabaya.She appealed to Government to increase deliveries of food relief to avert starvation in Bikita district, which is one of the districts hardest hit by drought. Cde Chabaya also decried the collapse of most irrigation schemes in Bikita West because of drought saying there was urgent need to rehabilitate the schemes by expediting the de-siltation programme ahead of the rainy season to improve the capacity to store irrigation water.
