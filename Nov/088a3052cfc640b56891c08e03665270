Naledi Sande Arts Reporter &#8212; Rising creative artist Calvin Mangwanya today holds his Solo Art Exhibition titled Tsimba in the Production department at Herald House. Currently working as a graphic designer at Zimpapers Harare branch, Mangwanya s exhibition is being held in partial fulfilment of Mangwanya s Bachelor of Science in Creative Art and Design degree programme at Chinhoyi University of Technology. The purpose of this exhibition is to showcase my artwork and designs that I have done throughout the course from 2013 to date, he said. It is also a preparatory platform that acclimatises me into the entrepreneurial arena as a professional graphic designer (artist), thus I have to convince the corporate world and general public to buy into my creativity. His artworks include paintings, drawings, graphic designs, photography, 3D creativity, motion/video graphics and illustrations. Mangwanya grew up with a passion for art and he always endeavoured to pursue it as a profession. The artwork is an expression of feelings, moods, compassion, visions and nature that I have been involved with in real life circumstances. He has used different media to express the different moods and visions in the artwork.The exhibition will showcase portraits such as Paita Rudo , model drawings and illustrations &#8211; Mukoko , landscapes, Kadongo , conceptual and abstract art 3D designs Muuyu and photography like Pagrowthpoint.
