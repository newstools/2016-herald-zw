Manchester. Jose Mourinho was sent to the stands as his Manchester United side drew 1-1 at home to West Ham United in the Premier League yesterday. Zlatan Ibrahimovic cancelled out Diafra Sakho s opening goal to leave United contemplating a run of four straight home league draws for the first time since Dave Sexton s managerial tenure in 1980-81. Mourinho, the current United manager, was dismissed by referee Jonathan Moss in the 27th minute when he kicked a water bottle in anger after midfielder Paul Pogba was cautioned for simulation. Mourinho, whose side have fallen 11 points below pace-setters Chelsea, now faces Football Association censure for the third time in barely two months.He served a one-match touchline ban and had to pay an 8 000 fine for arguing with referee Mark Clattenburg during the recent home draw with Burnley. Prior to that, he had been fined 50 000 by the FA for claiming Manchester-based referee Anthony Taylor would find it difficult to perform well in a game at Liverpool.To add to the volatile situation, Mourinho served a one-match stadium suspension last season, when Chelsea manager, after an angry confrontation with Moss during a game at West Ham.On that occasion the Portuguese had to be escorted from the referee s room at half-time by stadium security. Mourinho s mood at Old Trafford cannot have been helped by the fact his side conceded within two minutes of kick-off. AFP.
