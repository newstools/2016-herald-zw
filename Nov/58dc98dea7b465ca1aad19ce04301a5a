MADRID. Real Madrid s Cristiano Ronaldo silenced the doubters who were writing him off at the start of the season by moving to the top of Spanish La Liga s scoring chart with two goals on Saturday. Ronaldo s ninth and 10th goals of the campaign in a 2-1 win over Sporting Gijon moved him ahead of Barcelona rivals Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez, who have both found the net eight times.It is a pleasing turnaround for the Portugal captain, who faced heavy criticism at the start of the season when he still appeared to be reeling from a knee injury suffered in the Euro 2016 final.He made his worst ever goalscoring start to a season with Real, scoring four goals in his first eight games in all competitions, but has since returned to his usual form.
