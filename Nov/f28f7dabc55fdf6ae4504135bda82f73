The match, which is the Mighty Warriors last warm up assignment at home will kick off at 3pm.With the Women African Cup of Nations set to get underway in Cameroon on November 19 both the Mighty Warriors and Banyana Banyana are expected to travel to the West African country next week.The Mighty Warriors, whose preparations have been hampered by a host of problems related to lack of resources, played Egypt last month in another friendly match.There had been concern over Dzingirai s fitness after she received a knock last week, but Mlauzi was happy to see her back in full training ahead of today s match.Mlauzi said the return of Dzingirai for their last preparatory match is a major boost as they also have some rookie players who include Mwenezana goalkeeper Lisa Mpofu in camp. We welcome back Dzingirai who had a knock, but the doctor said she is now ready for match situations. The game against South Africa is the final preparatory friendly and we are going to take it seriously. It will be an opportunity to assess our players and try some combinations. The good thing is all the players are ready for the match and I believe we are going to do well, said Mlauzi.Mlauzi said he was not worried about having to face the South Africans in the friendly despite being in the same group with Banyana Banyana at the Nations Cup tournament.Both Zimbabwe and South Africa will be in Group A that also features Egypt and was quick to defend that they are taking on some of their opponents in Group A for friendlies so as to see how their performance can be in real game situations and said they are just preparatory matches.Zimbabwe has played Egypt and South Africa who are in the same Group of Death that also has Cameroon, but Mlauzi played down that he is using this as a yardstick. We cannot take results that come out of these friendlies as a true reflection of what we will expect at the finals. A lot will happen in the coming weeks so we cannot take this as a measure, but simply a practice match to try different combinations, Mlauzi said.
