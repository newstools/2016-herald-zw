Freeman Razemba recently in ShurugwiGOVERNMENT has challenged farmers to utilise land and stop relying on handouts from the State and donors. Addressing farmers at the Dairy Farmers Field Day in Tongogara, Shurugwi, Deputy Minister of Agriculture, Mechanisation and Irrigation Development (Livestock) Paddy Zhanda said he was aware drought had affected farmers, but over-reliance on donations must stop. I am aware that there is hunger here in Shurugwi and most of you are receiving grain from Government. Some of you have now developed a habit of waiting for Government to do something for you and this should stop. I have never heard any of you who have sold their cattle to buy grain because you have developed a habit of waiting for Government to give you something, he said.Deputy Minister Zhanda said most farmers were waiting for the Government to give them inputs. Even if you are given inputs, some will sell these inputs and when things go wrong, they will blame the Government again. Even on school fees, some men wait for Government to pay school fees for their children, he said.Police Anti-Stock Theft National Co-ordinator Senior Assistant Commissioner Erasmus Makodza said the force would continue to support dairy farmers. I want to encourage dairy farmers to immediately report any missing dairy cows to the nearest police station. Even if the cow is suspected to have strayed, the police must be informed so that we quickly activate our security apparatus, he said.
