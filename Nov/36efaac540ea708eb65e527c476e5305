LONDON. What kind of a difference can a year make? How about six positions, nine more points, four more wins and 15 more goals for starters? After 10 English Premier League soccer fixtures at the tail-end of October 2015, Liverpool were looking up at the likes of Southampton, Crystal Palace and West Ham in the standings.The Merseysiders were anaemic in attack, unable to adequately threaten opposition goalkeepers and let in more strikes than they were able to convert. Ninth, on 14 points, the Reds had only managed to see off Stoke, Bournemouth and Aston Villa none of those victories recorded compellingly. Of those opening 10 tests, Jurgen Klopp had only been in the dugout for two and after now overseeing 40 games in the division, a higher definition picture has been painted of his Liverpool.Sat on 23 points, level with Arsenal and Manchester City, having blitzed in 24 goals, only twice before have the Anfield outfit posted a better return in the English Premier League era. In 2008-09, they stormed to 26 points having not lost a match, but they had netted just 15 times. The Reds powered in five more goals during 2002-03, when they collected 24 points.The 1996-97 campaign mirrored the current one with a total of 23, with four fewer successful strikes.What of the start to 2013-14? When Liverpool went the closest to winning league title number 19?They had three fewer points than the current squad, seven fewer goals, as well as an inferior goal difference.While Klopp is correct in his assertion that October is no time to discuss title credentials, Liverpool s authoritative start to his first full season in charge cannot be overlooked.Especially after lining up against Chelsea, Arsenal and Tottenham away, hosting defending champions Leicester and Manchester United, facing off against an annoyingly formidable nemesis in Tony Pulis, and navigating a tricky Selhurst Park outing.
