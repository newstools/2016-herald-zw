Elita Chikwati Agriculture Reporter&#8212;The Meteorological Services Department (MSD) has warned of heavy rains in most parts of the country with flash floods expected in Manicaland and some parts of Mashonaland East over the weekend. In a statement yesterday, the MSD said heavy rains in excess of 50mm would affect most of Mashonaland provinces, Manicaland Province as well as north of Masvingo Province on Saturday and Sunday. A cloud band is expected to start entering Zimbabwe through Matabeleland provinces tomorrow, spreading eastwards into the country. While this is happening, moisture is also forecast to enter eastern areas of Zimbabwe from Zambia and Mozambique. The two cloud systems should merge and cover the whole country on Sunday. At the same time pressure should be rising off the Durban coast, increasing convergence across Zimbabwe. If these expected weather patterns behave as predicted, then indications are that there would be heavy downpours that may lead to potential flash flooding in Manicaland Province as well as parts of Mashonaland East Province, reads the statement.The department anticipates that falls in excess of 50mm in 24 hours may occur in these areas. Elsewhere, the ensuing rain and thunderstorms will, however, be generally light. In general, however, the rain and thunderstorms are expected countrywide. Of note in particular are the rains expected in Manicaland Province on Sunday 27 November that may cause potential flash flooding, said the MSD.The department will continue monitoring the conditions and update the public accordingly.The department requested the public to provide feedback or information on disasters as it is on Twitter, Facebook and WhatsApp.
