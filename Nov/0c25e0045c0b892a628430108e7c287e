Naledi Sande Arts Reporter &#8212; A new documentary film that sheds more light on a Christian culture known as the Advent was recently launched in the capital. Titled The Advent , the film was directed by Father Tendai Reki Mashayamombe of the Roman Catholic church and it explores the phenomenon which is centred on festive preparation.In the documentary, Father Reki shares a number of issues related to the Advent and emphasised the importance of communicating with God.Father Reki says, The season of advent is a season of communication, the most important being what God is trying to communicate with us. The church celebrates Advent for about four weeks, preparing for the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ. A member of the Roman Catholic church who also features on the documentary said the Advent season means people should stop partying and focus on the coming of Christ. The Advent season is when our Catholic year begins and from there we humble ourselves before the Lord, said the member who identified herself as Ms Nyamutumba. The same way we prepare for the coming of visitors is the same way we prepare for the coming of Christ. Families and societies in the world are falling apart and this shows the importance of Advent, Fr Reki said. The Advent season is the moment we are calling God more because God gives value to humanity. It teaches us to hold on to God and prepare by reading scriptures and understanding the theologies within the scriptures of Advent. The 16-minute documentary film was produced by Nqobizitha Mlilo of Nafuna TV.
