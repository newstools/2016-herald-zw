Mr Zaranyika said he was confident that the 2016-7 summer cropping season would be a productive one compared to the 2015-6 season which was characterised by the El Nino-induced drought.Mr Zaranyika who is also the Zimbabwe Seed Traders Association boss assured the nation of enough seed stocks and said there could be surplus for the next season. Good things are likely to happen this season. We started stocking our outlets as early as July. There is no seed shortage. We can have a bit of carry over into the next season. We should utilise the rainfall so food shortages become a thing of the past. In support of the initiatives to ensure food security we have not increased seed prices. We have had to reduce prices in some instances, he said.He said Seed Co agronomists were on the ground nationwide to assist farmers choose the correct varieties and offer agronomic advice. Our teams are on the ground working with farmers to ensure full utilisation of all arable land. Our agronomists are motivating and encouraging farmers to take advantage of the current moisture content. We see Zimbabwe turning around. As we speak, east Africa is dry. They have not received rains yet. Neighbouring countries like Zambia have not yet received planting rains, so this is an opportunity which we need to maximise on, he said.
