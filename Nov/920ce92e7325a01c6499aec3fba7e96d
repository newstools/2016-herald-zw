 Grace Chingoma Senior Sports Reporter AFTER having received a seal of approval from the legendary Moses Bambo Chunga, young Sweden-based Zimbabwean international soccer striker Tinotenda Kadewere is now relishing the opportunity of playing for the Warriors at next year s African Cup of Nations finals in Gabon.In fact, hard work is beginning to pay off for the talented Highfield-born striker who is now looking to make his claim among the big boys for the African Cup of Nations finals in Gabon in January next year after he was drafted into the Warriors squad for the international friendly match against Tanzania at the National Sports Stadium next Sunday.Although national team coach Callisto Pasuwa is tomorrow expected to make an official announcement of the squad to play the Taifa Stars, The Herald can exclusively reveal that the youthful forward is among a number of foreign-based players who are coming home for the match which falls under the FIFA international calendar of November 7 to 13.The call-up comes at a time when the 20-year-old has been doing well for his Swedish top-flight club Djurg rdens IF.Last Monday Kadewere scored a superb goal, his fourth in the Allsvenskan league which concluded yesterday.And now Kadewere, who has risen through the ranks in the national age-group teams, has big ambitions as the Warriors African Cup of Nations preparations begin to gather momentum.Speaking from his base in Sweden yesterday, the former Harare City striker said he was humbled by the Warriors call-up.&nbsp;Humbled It is a great achievement for me to get a national team call-up and it s something I have been praying for and working really hard to get, so I m really glad that he (Pasuwa) has considered me for this game. I m surely looking forward to it and willing to give more than what I can to get into the coach s plans, said Kadewere.Kadewere last year earned his first cap in the home-grown Warriors squad when he played in the CHAN qualifiers against Comoros.However, it is the recognition in the senior squad for the international friendly match against Tanzania, which the coach wants to assess the players for the AFCON finals, that has left him excited.The former Prince Edward High School pupil, who turns 21 on January 5, is already dreaming of a place as one of the youngest players at the Nations Cup finals in Gabon next year.However, he reckons that getting a place into the Warriors squad for the AFCON finals would be a tall order for him although he is not intimidated by the com- petition. The position I play has so many good players like Tendai Ndoro, Knowledge Musona and Nyasha Mushekwi, to mention but just a few, but it s all in the coaches hands. I just want to keep on working hard to get a chance. But it s the same scenario at my club. I had four strikers ahead of me, the coach played me as a winger and also as a central midfielder but now I m one of the top strikers, so it s a big step ahead. Going to a big tournament such as AFCON at an early age of 21 is certainly good for confidence boosting. Everyone wishes to see Zimbabwe at the World Cup and it starts now by being prepared and playing at a tournament like the African Cup of Nations. So I am going to work hard to be part of the team, he said.Kadewere is more at home as a central striker but sometimes he is deployed in various attacking positions at his club.&nbsp;Technically GiftedThe athlete, who cut his football teeth at an academy in Highfield owned by his late father Onias, is one of the technically gifted players of his generation.He has strong attributes in ball control, shooting, impact, pace and recovery.The tall forward moved to Sweden last August as a direct replacement for fellow Zimbabwean international striker Nyasha Mushekwi who moved to China. Kadewere immediately made a huge impact at Djurg rdens IF.Kadewere is certainly earning his stripes at the club which is affectionately known as the Blue Stripes in Sweden where he has started in the last five matches partnering a fellow African player in attack, Kenyan Michael Olunga. I have worked with two different coaches since I got here, they both believed in me and saw the potential in me. Our sports director is even planning to come to Zimbabwe because he now believes that there is much talent there, said Kadewere.The 20-year-old recently got a rare praise from Dynamos legend Moses Bambo Chunga, who boldly declared that in the current crop of local players, the young striker is the only player who may come a distant closer to his playing prowess during his (Chunga s) heydays. When I first saw the comment from Chunga, I felt motivated. It is such a great honour for a legend like him to mention my name. I am really thankful but to get close to what he achieved it needs some extra work; always fighting to be the best in everything you do, he said.The Highfield-born footballer says he has settled very well in Stockholm with his young family of wife Sharon and son Keith. My family back home are always there for me in prayers and I am grateful that my wife is here and that makes things go pretty well, he said.
