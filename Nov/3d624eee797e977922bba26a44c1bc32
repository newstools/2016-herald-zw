Musician Oliver Mtukudzi yesterday retraced his steps to his former school, Chipembere Primary where he donated several pairs of shoes from his Hai-Kobo footwear brand. Hai-Kobo will launch the school shoe line on December 6 at an auction of shoes from many other lines under the brand. Mtukudzi attended Chipembere Primary School between 1958 and 1964. The donation targets disadvantaged pupils at the school.
