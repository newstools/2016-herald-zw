Cde ChomboAbel Zhakata in NyanyadziZANU-PF has intensified campaigns ahead of the Chimanimani West by election on Saturday with three Politburo members jointly holding over-subscribed rallies yesterday at two venues in Ward Five and Nyanyadzi Primary School. Secretary for administration, Dr Ignatius Chombo, political commissar Cde Saviour Kasukuwere, secretary for transport and welfare, Cde Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri hit the ground running in the morning and sowed the seeds of unity among party supporters to ensure a resounding victory.Zanu &#8211; PF s candidate, Cde Nokuthula Matsikenyere will battle it out with Mr Peter Gudyanga (Renewal Democrats of Zimbabwe), Mr Edmore Mtetwa (Independent) and Mr Pesanai Musakaruka (National Constitutional Assembly).Villagers were given an opportunity to raise their concerns and at the two venues, which are barely two kilometres apart, topical issues revolved around diamond mining at Chiadzwa, irrigation schemes, Zinwa water arrears as well as Zesa electricity charges.The campaigning team, which also comprised of Central Committee members, Dr Joseph Made, Cdes Joseph Chinotimba and Mandi Chimene, took turns to respond, clearing the air on some misconstrued issues that had created confusion among the electorate.Dr Chombo told supporters that Government would ensure that 80 percent of the people who worked at the Zimbabwe Consolidated Diamond Mine at Chiadzwa, were villagers from the Marange community and surrounding areas.He said this was a way of empowering the locals to derive meaningful benefits from the precious gems. Dr Chombo said the party had since communicated with the Ministry of Mines and Mining Development to implement the employment percentage ratio. It is disheartening to note that the local Marange community has nothing to show for the diamonds that were mined here for years. Roads are in bad shape, there are shortages of clinics and we are facing irrigation problems. We have heard your concerns and, as Government, we will ensure that 80 percent of the workers at the mines must come from surrounding villages. The prevailing situation at the mines at the moment is that we have more foreigners there and yet we have able-bodied unemployed youths in the villages who are struggling to make ends meet. We have told Minister Chidhakwa of your concerns and the situation will soon change. Of the number that is going to be employed at the mines, 80 percent must be locals and the remaining 20 percent will cater for foreigners, he said and added: The issue of Community Share Ownership Trusts must be resolved quickly. Instead of getting the promised $10 million from the miners, we are told that not even a cent was given to the Trust.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
