Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports ReporterALL is set for this year s edition of the Regional Taekwondo Championships Ambassador s Cup at the University of Zimbabwe with several top karatekas taking part today. The event has seen athletes from South Africa, Mozambique, Zambia and Botswana coming for the big event. Top karateka Itai Samuel Sango, who will compete in the heavyweight category (+87kg), has vowed to defend the title he won last year. Sango, a black belt second dan, will be among high-profile karatekas gracing the big occasion. It will be an emotional homecoming for me after several years in Mozambique and I look forward to a lot of competition, he said. My intention is to add another medal to the 33 which I already have. Ranked 76th in the world, the champion said he was contemplating returning home. My aim now is to come back home and represent my home country as I believe they need me but the challenge is that of sponsorship. There is talent back home and they only need support and tournaments like these are important for us as they enable us to see how well we are progressing, said Sango.Sango has the experience of having participated in big tournaments in countries like Azerbaijan, Mexico, South Korea, Tunisia, Mali, Senegal, South Africa and Madagascar. Last year he took part in the World Championships in Russia after he made his debut in South Korea in 2011. When we were growing up, a sport like karate was viewed as violent but with the support I received from the likes of my coach Zito Mata, Annie Majeka, Mange Meqeu Mario, Oliver Makeleni, Brenda Nyamundanda, Leonielde Rungo among others, I have made it, said Sango.
