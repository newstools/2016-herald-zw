LOS ANGELES. A Floyd Mayweather-Manny Pacquiao boxing rematch is 75 percent likely to happen, according to Bob Arum. The Top Rank promoter, who looks after Pacquiao, believes public demand will see the long-standing rivals repeat their Fight of the Century . Mayweather announced his retirement last September, but was ringside in Las Vegas on Saturday night to see Pacquiao regain the WBO welterweight title. Arum has not suggested talks have taken place with The Money Team, but is still confident a rematch will take place. I give it 75 per cent, he told espn.com. Do I know it s gonna happen? No. Do I know if Floyd wants the fight? No. I know nothing more than the public knows at this point and what I observed. Mayweather has been lined with returning to the ring on numerous occasions since ending his career with a 49-0 record, with the unanimous points win over Pacquiao last May his penultimate fight.Pacquiao has returned to the Philippines to resume his political career but Arum expects a rematch with Mayweather will be easier to make than their first fight, which took five years to put together. It was so tense last time, but it won t be that way now because everyone can get along, he said. Floyd came to the fight and he was very friendly with (Top Rank president) Todd (duBoef) and some of our staff. Sky Sports.
