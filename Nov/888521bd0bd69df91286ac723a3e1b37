LONDON. &#8211; West Bromwich Albion climbed into the top half of the English Premier League soccer table after scoring three times in the first half in a clinical 4-0 home victory over Burnley on Monday night. Matt Phillips struck after just four minutes at The Hawthorns after Dean Marney inadvertently rolled the ball into his path and even though the away side saw plenty of the ball, West Brom made it 2-0 soon after.On 16 minutes Salomon Rondon set up James Morrison to shoot past Tom Heaton into the bottom corner after Burnley failed to close the midfielder down on the edge of the box.Phillips went close again and Burnley seemed determined to press the self-destruct button, with England international Heaton gifting the ball to Morrison, but he sliced wide.Heaton then redeemed himself to stop a Rondon curler that was destined for the top corner. - AFP.
