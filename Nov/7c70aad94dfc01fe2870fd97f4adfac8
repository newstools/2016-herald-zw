Zimbabwe and South Africa have historically been key partners in trade and investment with the symbiotic relationship quite evident in their respective economies. It is, therefore, only logical and quite prudent that they have decided to take this partnership to a new level. SA is in fact Zimbabwe s largest trading partner while a significant portion of the former s Gross Domestic Product is attributed to its trade and investment links with this country. Zimbabwe is a huge market for SA s produce and investment even after the introduction of Statutory Instrument 64 that limits the amount of imports coming into this country.Thus, the inaugural session of the Bi-National Commission (BNC) between the two countries which began here yesterday is set to cement the strong ties while also pursuing new avenues to boost trade and investment, among other facets of their relationship.In fact, the sound union on the economic front is premised on strong political ties between the two countries dating back to the days of the apartheid regime where Zimbabwe offered immense support, while SA has been instrumental in helping shape this country s political landscape. It is, therefore, without question that these countries can hardly do without each other.That SA s President Jacob Zuma is leading a delegation of eight cabinet ministers shows the seriousness of the discussions, coupled with the involvement and endorsement by the two neighbours highest offices in the form of President Mugabe and his SA counterpart. This should be viewed as a reflection of the importance with which they regard a solid socio-economic partnership.We believe the commitment demonstrated by the two Presidents will give impetus to this week s negotiations and discussions where the trading partners should emerge victorious. The Bi-National Commission will supersede the Joint Commission for Cooperation signed between the two countries in 1995.Officials from the two countries should immediately get down to business and iron out any contentious issues while exploring more ways through which the trade and investment links can be consolidated. For instance, SA has expressed concern over such issues as certain provisions of the SI 64 while Zimbabwe has a few issues on the SA trade climate that need handling to improve economic activities between the two countries.Zimbabwe needs to re-industrialise and become the powerhouse it has always been while SA, whose economy has suffered major shocks, largely emanating from the highly volatile rand, will need to summon their muscles to win the day, hence the prosper-thy-neighbour initiative.We implore the ministers and various representatives to emerge with a more holistic and formidable deal that takes into account the concerns and aspirations of the two countries. Not only will the BNC benefit the two countries but we believe it will feed into regional economic integration and ultimately equip the countries to get their fair share on the grand stage.In a world that is fast turning into a global village, it is only prudent that countries realise that they are not living in isolation and that on the highly competitive international trade or investment markets, comfort is indeed found in numbers.The private sector needs to take advantage of the political will from both countries and the launch of the BNC which will bring with it huge trade and investment opportunities. It is critical that this sector realises that the creation of an enabling and facilitative environment will require a witty private sector to seize opportunities and run with them.We note the joint efforts between the Government and private sector in search of solutions to re-ignite the economy. Therefore, the BNC is another platform through which the smart partnership can be consolidated.Overall such engagements and agreements as the BNC afford Zimbabwe particularly, with an opportunity to fend off machinations by the West which has largely been bent on destabilising the economy to achieve their regime change agenda.But Zimbabwe has remained resolute in its pursuit of partners elsewhere while not necessarily closing the door for those in the West that are sincere in their intentions to do business with this country.As the year draws to a close, Zimbabwe s economy is set to return to a growth trajectory, sustained by such initiatives as the BNC.
