Grace Chingoma Senior Sports ReporterMIGHTY Warriors poster girl Rudo Neshamba has been ruled out of the Africa Women Cup of Nations after she was omitted in the 26-member squad named by coach Shadreck Mlauzi yesterday. The tournament begins on November 19 and runs until December 3 in Cameroon.According to CAF, 21 players are accredited to feature for the women s tournament. Mlauzi is expected to drop five players before departure.Neshamba is not part of the players who went into camp yesterday to mark the beginning of their training programme.The 24-year-old striker has a chronic knee injury which she sustained while still in primary school.She was supposed to go under the knife but Warriors doctor Nicholas Munyonga has prescribed a treatment programme which could see her heal completely.Neshamba was the hero when Zimbabwe booked an historic place to the Olympic Games scoring in both legs of the final qualifier against Cameroon. It is a major blow. Rudo is a natural goal-scorer, very clever but we have to consider her future, we want her in the long term, said Munyonga. We gambled with her at the Olympics and she was clearly not at her best so we didn t want to risk again this time around. We have been lobbying for financial assistance for her to go for an operation but it has not been forthcoming. Doctor Munyonga has given her some treatment so it is only natural that healing takes place. We are going for a major tournament so we want all our players to be at their best. Three more players who were at the Olympics Daisy Kaitano, Erina Jeke and Samkelisiwe Zulu are also out of for the AFCON tournament.Mlauzi has kept faith with the bulk of the players who went to Brazil adding a few new faces to the squad.He has drafted six rookie players Mwenezana goalkeeper Lisa Mpofu, Cosa Guruve defender Sarudzai Chikowore, Sifundile Moyo, Happiness Gumbo, Maud Mafuruse and Sibonginkosi Nleya.The Mighty Warriors will host South Africa in an international friendly at Barbourfields next week.Interestingly, the two teams, will meet again nine days later in a competitive match in Yaounde.Zimbabwe, South Africa, hosts Cameroon and Egypt are in Group A which will be based in Yaounde.Group B has defending champions Nigeria, whose coach has gone for eight months without being paid, Ghana, Mali and Kenya.They will be based in Limbe.Meanwhile, the Mighty Warriors fund-raising dinner, which took place on Wednesday night at the Rainbow Towers, saw a number of companies such as Old Mutual, CBZ, Rainbow Towers, Nyaradzo, Telecel, Zimbabwe Cricket, the Premier Soccer League and Price Waterhouse Coopers purchasing tables.A car raffle has also been organised by the same committee.SquadGoalkeepers: Chido Dzingirai (Flame Lily), Lindiwe Magwede (Cyclone), Manyara Mandara (Mwenezana), Lisa Mpofu (Mwenezana).Defenders: Danai Bhobho (Mwenezana), Nobuhle Majika (Inline Academy), Sarudzai Chikowore (COSA Guruve), Nokubhosi Ncube (New Orleans), Ruvimbo Mutyavaviri (Mufakose Queens), Sheila Makoto (Blue Swallows), Patience Mujuru (Black Rhinos), Viola Mpofu (Inline Academy), Eunice Chibanda (Black Rhinos).Midfielders: Emmaculate Msipa (Black Rhinos), Mavis Chirandu (Weerams), Marjoury Nyaumwe (Flame Lily), Talent Mandaza (Black Rhinos), Aldigrade Bhamu (Mufakose), Sifundile Moyo (Inline), Happiness Gumbo (Heart of Oak).Strikers: Rutendo Makore (Black Rhinos), Berita Kabwe (Flame Lily), Sibonginkosi Nleya (Weerams), Felistus Muzongondi (Black Rhinos), Kudakwashe Basopo (Black Rhinos), Maud Mafuruse (Cyclone)
