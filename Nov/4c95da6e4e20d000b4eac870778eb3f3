President Jacob ZumaJOHANNESBURG. &#8211; Six candidates are bidding to succeed President Jacob Zuma as the leader of the African National Congress next year as the ruling party starts the process this weekend to choose its next president, according its secretary-general Gwede Mantashe. There s six people who have raised their hand that they want to be president of the party, Mantashe (61) said in an interview on Thursday at Bloomberg s Johannesburg office. What we have agreed on is that there must a debate openly. While the 104-year-old ANC suffered its worst performance in the municipal elections in August, the new leader will need to reach out to millions of ANC supporters who stayed away from the polls at a time when Zuma was implicated in a series of scandals and the economy skirted a second recession in seven years.The ANC has won every election since the end of apartheid in 1994.Top party officials will from this weekend start a political education roadshow to speak to members at branches to help facilitate the process of electing a new leader at its five-yearly conference in December next year, Mantashe said.President Zuma, whose second term as president of the country ends in 2019, has led the ANC since 2007.Mantashe didn t name any of the candidates, but President Zuma isn t one of the six candidates and isn t expected to seek re-election, Mantashe said. I don t think he will stand for the third term. He s not in the six. It would be a mistake to stand for a third term, he said. It s not an unspoken rule, it s actually spoken because we go on to say the president of the ANC is the ANC candidate for the president of the country. &#8211; AFP.
