Elita Chikwati Agriculture Reporter Government has warned farmers to be on the lookout for stalk borer (Chilo) that has already destroyed 250 hectares of irrigated maize in some areas. The affected areas are Matabeleland North, Midlands and some areas in Mashonaland East (Marondera) and there are fears the outbreak may spread countrywide if not controlled on time. The Chilo may seriously affect yields if measures are not taken on time.Agriculture, Mechanisation and Irrigation Development Deputy Minister Responsible for Crops Cde Davis Marapira yesterday raised concern over the pest that he said could be difficult to control since most chemicals used for controlling the stalk borer were now banned.He said Agritex officers countrywide should be on the lookout and also carry out intensive awareness campaigns to farmers to educate them about the pest. The pest has destroyed 200 hectares of maize in Bubi, Matabeleland North and 50 hectares in Midlands and has been detected in Marondera. Farmers should be on the lookout for the Chilo. The stalk borer can reduce yields extensively if not controlled on time. We are afraid this may become a national problem. The pest attacks the crop at knee height level and upwards. Farmers can take preventive measures and the Plant Protection Department should assist farmers, he said.Deputy Minister Marapira said farmers should inform Agritex officers early when they saw the pest in their area. The pest usually causes problems when temperatures are very high. Last year we had a challenge with the pest and I think it was not controlled properly. The pest was also detected in wheat in Zambia last season, he said.The stalk borer attacks primary hosts maize and sorghum while its secondary hosts are pearl millet, finger millet and sugarcane.
