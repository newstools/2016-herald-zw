JUBA. &#8211; The South Sudanese government on Wednesday launched a massive one-year teacher training programme to boost the country s ailing early education sector plagued by a lack of teachers and high dropout rates. The new programme is expected to add 17 600 primary school instructors to the country s current total of 28 000. South Sudan s education indicators remain among the worst in the world.The pupil-teacher ratio stands at 50 pupils to one teacher, according to data from the education min- istry.The ministry said they are looking at improving the quality of education provided throughout the country before the launch of a new education curriculum in 2018.Acting Undersecretary in the Ministry of General Education and Instruction Abdulai Ali said to fix the current crisis in the education sector, collective efforts especially in the areas of teacher training and remuneration must be geared up to make the teaching profession more attractive. Some 1.8 million children in South Sudan are already out of school. This is a huge number. So we must work very hard to bring back this big number, Ali said. &#8211; Xinhua.
