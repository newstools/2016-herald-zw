A motorist was Tuesday afternoon captured on video attempting to break off a clamp after his vehicle, a Nissan Bluebird Sylphy had been impounded by municipal police along George Silundika Avenue between First and Sam Nujoma streets in the central business district of Harare. The reasons for the clamping could not be ascertained as none of the municipal officers entertained questions from the media. In the video, the visibly enraged motorist is seen trying to drive away with the clamp still binding the right rear wheel, in the meantime attracting public attention. The attempt turns out to be rather retrogressive as the vehicle&#8217;s rear bumper gets damaged in the process. At one point the motorist, a middle aged man, tries to break the clamp with bare hands but fails to snap the device before driving away with the wheel still bound by the clamp. &#8211; Happiness Chikwanha, Online reporter&nbsp;
