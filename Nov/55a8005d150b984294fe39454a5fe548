Tedious Manyepo Sports Reporter&#8212;CAPS United defender Dennis Dauda knows what it means to lose the championship race when success appears to be in sight. He was the star of the ZPC Kariba team that fell at the final hurdle, ironically against CAPS United, to hand the trophy to Dynamos. Now Dauda doesn t want lightning to strike twice. I have spoken to my teammates about that and they have all understood me clearly, said the defender who has been the outstanding player of the second half of the season. I will also speak to them on Friday (today) about it. The message is simple. We should not get carried away by the prospects of the impending success as we could be left to curse the gods like what happened when I was still with ZPC Kariba. We thought it was done and dusted, but we failed to cross the finishing line ahead of the others as we had anticipated. Dauda said focus was key for the Green Machine. We have the chance to win the title this year, but we should stay focused, he said. I don t want to experience the same cruel situation which I had in 2014. We have to beat Ngezi Platinum on Sunday and then beat Chapungu in the following match without necessarily looking at other results and we will be done for the season. I want to be a champion and play in the CAF Champions League. Ngezi Platinum and FC Platinum are sister clubs and social media has been abuzz with reports that the Zvishavane miners have promised their Mhondoro counterparts huge bonuses should they beat or hold Makepekepe on Sunday.Then, there is the Dynamos element, which is provided by coach Tonderai Ndiraya and a number of his players, who used to be at Glamour Boys.It s an open secret that the DeMbare fans don t want Makepekepe to be champions and will be rooting for Ngezi Platinum.
