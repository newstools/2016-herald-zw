Fungai Lupande Court ReporterA personal banker with ZB Bank allegedly swindled the bank of over $14 000 after tampering with depositors accounts. Abel Takaruva (41) pleaded not guilty to 34 counts fraud. In his defence, Takaruva said the State had mixed up the bank s cash outflow and mere set-offs. A fair determination cannot be realised without involving independent, competent accounting personnel, he said.Prosecuting, Mr Usheunesu Mhiti told the court that Takaruva was stationed at ZB Bank Douglas Road branch in Harare s Workington area and his duties included disbursing loans to the bank s clients.He had access to the bank s loan system and could facilitate the transfer of money without authorisation by a supervisor.It is alleged that between April 2011, and June 2015 Takaruva increased the loans of clients who were servicing their loans.Afterwards, Takaruva allegedly withdrew the money from various automated teller machine (ATMs) using bank cards he fraudulently obtained.To cover up the offence, he allegedly deducted money from those loans and credited the money into the bank s loan interest account and other bank accounts.The court heard that Takaruva made a double prejudice of bank increase and loan repayment of $11 039,62.The offence came to light after Trust Me Security approached the bank inquiring why money was being deducted from their account when they never applied for a loan.It is alleged that in June 2014 Takaruva instructed his jobless churchmate, Trynos Mutema, to open a bank account under his super- vision.He gave him a cheque book since he was responsible for authorising overdraft facilities and unpaying cheques drawn against unfunded accounts.Takaruva authorised a cheque withdrawal of $1 461 in Mutema s unfunded account between July 2014 and January 2015, it is alleged.The court heard that in July 2014 Takaruva linked his daughter s account to Judith Ndoro who had a balance of $5 131.He advised Ndoro to withdraw $2 000 from her account because her money would accrue an interest of 11 percent every month.It is alleged between July 29, 2014 and October 9, 2015 Takaruva transferred $1 867 from Ndoro s account into his daughter s account.The bank lost $14 367, 62 and nothing was recovered.
