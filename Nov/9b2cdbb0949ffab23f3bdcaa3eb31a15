We hoped to stage the Summer Night concert a week or two ago but a change of venue made it necessary for us to host this family-focused show at Twin Rivers School, she said.Walters said the concert is an event where people will enjoy music in a relaxed, open-air environment where they can bring picnics, their own chairs and blankets. This show will also see some of the top local talent, tenor Nigel Hopkins and soprano Molly Dzangare, who featured last year and is carving out a singing career on the classical scene.

He has been starring in Barnyard shows and other musical events across South Africa.The Summer Night concert brings Ansley back to the audience who met and loved him when he first appeared on the stage.Meanwhile, Phillip Hanly comes from a well-known theatrical family in Harare and has started making a name for himself in South Africa. Hanly was part of the Born to Perform talent search show in Johannesburg.The 20-years-old s voice has been compared to those of Josh Groban and Michael Bubble.
