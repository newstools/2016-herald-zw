SOUTHAMPTON. Antonio Conte insists it is too soon to label Chelsea English Premier League soccer title contenders after his side maintained their impressive run with a 2-0 victory at Southampton. Conte s team have reeled off four successive league wins for the first time in 18 months and they sit just one point behind leaders Manchester City following their no-nonsense display at St Mary s on Sunday. Eden Hazard opened the scoring with a clinical strike in the sixth minute and Diego Costa s sublime curler in the second half wrapped up the points for the Blues.Chelsea have double the number of points they had at the same stage of a miserable campaign last season and the confident nature of their performance against in-form Southampton suggests Conte is beginning to make his presence felt.The Chelsea boss wouldn t be drawn into declaring his side potential champions, although he did admit he is feeling increasingly confident that his rebuilding job is taking shape.
