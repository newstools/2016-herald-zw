The tournament, which ends on December 4, will see 16 countries participating and have been drawn into four pools.Zimbabwe are pooled against USA, Korea and the Netherlands in Pool A.They begin their campaign against the United States today and had two warm-up matches early this week against South Africa and France.They lost 2-0 to South Africa and drew 1-1 with France.Speaking from Chile, Palmer said the girls are in good spirits and remain confident they will put up a good fight. It was an outstanding performance from our girls. We did lose 2-0 (against South Africa) but from two unfortunate goals and the scoreline was certainly not a true reflection of the game and how hard and well the girls played. It was a fantastic confidence booster for the girls and has most certainly lifted their spirits and self-esteem. Previously (during the qualifiers) we lost to South Africa 10-0. So South Africa were very surprised. We are expecting a good competitive match against the USA as the girls have settled their nerves and have the confidence to attack against any calibre of team we are pitted against, said Palmer.Their second game is on tomorrow against Korea and they will wrap up the pool matches on Sunday against the Netherlands.Jessica Dollar scored for Zimbabwe in their other warm-up match against France.Zimbabwe had their last practice session yesterday with the coaches working on the finer details of the game such as 16-yard hit-outs and short corners.Pool B has Argentina, France, Germany and Japan while Australia, Chile, England and South Africa makes up Pool C.Pool D is made up of Belgium, China, New Zealand and Spain.The top two countries from the four pools will meet in the quarter-finals on November 30 and the winners will progress to the semi-finals with the finals slated for December 4.The losing teams will play for rankings.Zimbabwe finished on position 16 in their last appearance at the tournament in 2005 when Chile hosted the event.
