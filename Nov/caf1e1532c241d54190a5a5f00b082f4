SYDNEY. South African middle-order batsman Temba Bavuma has admitted to feeling pressure ahead of the Australian Test cricket series. But the 11 Test-capped batsman will take the pressure in his stride when walking out for the first time at the WACA tomorrow. Bavuma (26) alluded that his main goal is to score runs and make sure he executes to the best of his ability, saying: That will allow the bowlers to attack and do what they do. For us, we re focusing on all our disciplines and our fielding, (which) we put a lot of importance and significance on. So it s just to make sure we execute our three disciplines to the best of our ability. Bavuma hinted that South Africa might go into the first Test with seven specialist batsmen, which could result in one of the four Proteas paceman to miss out on the pace and bounce offered in Perth. It s worked up to now, says Bavuma when asked whether or not they will go into the Test with seven batsmen. AFP.
