Dr ParirenyatwaPaidamoyo Chipunza Senior Health Reporter Four cases of cholera have been confirmed in Mwenezi District, Masvingo Province, with Government calling for improved hygienic practices and sanitary services across the country as the rains begin. According to sources, the four people were part of 300 other worshippers of an apostolic sect popularly known as Jekenisheni who were gathering near Rutenga.The affected were, however, attended to and discharged from the clinic.This latest development brings the total number of cholera cases recorded in the district to eight since the beginning of the year.Health and Child Care Minister Dr David Parirenyatwa said the outbreak was now under control after teams were dispatched to the district. The outbreak is now under control and none of the affected died. They were all treated and have since been discharged from the clinic, said Dr Parirenyatwa.He, however, called on all Zimbabweans to be more health cautious by abiding to recommended hygienic standards especially now that the rains have began.Dr Parirenyatwa said this is the season where outbreaks are likely to emerge if proper hygienic practices are not stuck to. We are alert. We want our people to know that now is the time to be careful of the water they drink, otherwise we will have severe outbreaks. Our people must also be alert as much as possible. If the water is suspicious, let us boil it at the point of use, said Dr Parirenyatwa.He said the risk of water-borne diseases was much higher now because of the rains which have the potential of washing away all the dirt, some of which could be contaminated, into shallow and unprotected water sources.Sometimes these water bodies are sources of water for household consumption for some communities, both urban and rural.Dr Parirenyatwa said this was the season of mazhanje and mangoes that are sold along the streets. People should wash these fruits with clean water before consumption and if possible, they must avoid handshaking as they might also pass on bacteria from one person to another, he said.Zimbabwe is still nursing the wounds of a cholera outbreak it experienced between the 2008 and 2009 season where over 4 000 people died and about 12 000 others were treated of the disease.
