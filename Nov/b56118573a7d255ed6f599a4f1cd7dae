Bipin Dani in MUMBAI, India ZIMBABWE S top order batsman Chamu Chibhabha was keen to beat his highest individual score of 99 as he played his 99th ODI match yesterday. Unfortunately, it could not happen and in the fifth over he was trapped lbw by Nuwan Kulasekara. Obviously it would have been nice to get a 100, but it hasn t happened yet and I ll keep working hard towards that , he said. It would be awesome to get the 100 on my 100th ODI (against West Indies on Friday). It has been a journey since I ve made my debut and I ve had my share of adversity, but it s been all worth it .Chibhabha had a poor debut match (against New Zealand at Harare in 2005) when he registered a duck. It wasn t the sort of start I had hoped for, but getting the opportunity to represent my country at that age is something I will always look back and be grateful for. I will not be under pressure on Friday. I am just gonna embrace the moment as it is a very important game for the team. It would be fantastic if I score a ton in the match, he said.
