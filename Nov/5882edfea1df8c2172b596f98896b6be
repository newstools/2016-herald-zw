Petros Kausiyo Deputy Sports EditorAS the cloud of uncertainty continues to hang over the Premier Soccer League relegation puzzle, it has emerged that the ZIFA Assembly s vote to try and demote four teams from the top-flight league is procedurally flawed. The ZIFA Assembly made a stunning about-turn at their annual meeting in Harare at the end of last month and reversed a decision they made on July 25 last year, which paved way for the relegation of two teams from the elite league this year.That resolution also set the platform for promotional play-offs involving the winners of the regional Division One leagues.But in a stunning turn of events that seems to have been more emotional than it was rational, the councillors smuggled the relegation issue onto the agenda in contravention of the statutes governing the national game.That decision has also left the domestic game sharply divided with the PSL and their member clubs on one side fiercely opposed to a late notification of change in relegation format and a section of the ZIFA Assembly on the other pressing to have four teams demoted.There are also genuine fears that ZIFA could face long-dragging court disputes over the ill-timed move, which came with just two rounds of the 2016 Premiership games to play.Surprisingly, the Sport and Recreation Commission who had been expected to give direction and mediate in the row have adopted a wait and see approach with the supreme sports body hoping for a peaceful solution to emanate from the warring parties.The Sports Commission are custodians of all the sporting associations constitutions and the supreme body s officials could have reminded the ZIFA councillors of the violation of a resolution that was adopted and minuted at their last annual meeting.But The Herald can reveal that minutes of deliberations pertaining to the relegation and promotion puzzle point to a ZIFA Assembly that has gone offside on their own resolutions. Four (4) teams would be promoted and demoted after the 2015 season. Two teams would be promoted and demoted after 2016 season with the PSL funding the promotional play-offs, reads part of the minutes of that July 25, 2015 indaba.There are also some procedural flaws in the manner in which ZIFA councillors reportedly led by Northern Region s Martin Kweza and Southern Region boss Musa Mandaza ignored a requirement of at least 30 days notice for a motion to be discussed at such an indaba.While the councillors seem to have cited the PSL s alleged failure to honour a pledge to fund the play-offs, the fallout appears to have been premised on a debt of gratitude that was not fulfilled.That debt of gratitude was based on the fact that while the PSL had supported the councillors when they revoked the mandate of the previous ZIFA board last year, the league would fund the promotional play-offs.But more worryingly is the fact that the assembly ignored a resolution they made in terms of their constitution and instead brought in a fresh motion from the floor at an annual meeting without at least 30 days notice having been given for that motion to be tabled.The relegation-promotion was not part of the agenda of the latest ZIFA annual meeting and only came to light after Northern region s Martin Kweza and Southern region boss Musa Mandaza led debate on the matter.Ironically, the councillors chose to vote on the issue of relegation when they had earlier in the same meeting adopted the minutes of the July 25 meeting.That the regional chairmen met as late as September this year to prepare for the play-offs and had tasked ZIFA Communications and Competitions manager Xolisani Gwesela with drafting the play-offs show that the assembly knew of the resolution to demote only two teams from the Premiership.

There was no other business and the meeting ended at 12.30pm with a closing prayer from Mr Manyengavana, read part of the minutes.It is against the background of such meetings as the one attended by the regional chairmen, the resolutions made at the last annual meeting and the constitutional requirements such as Article 27 of the statutes which render the councillors move a nullity.Article 27.1 states that: The General Secretary shall draw up the agenda based on proposals from the Executive Committee and the Members. Any proposal that a Member wishes to submit to the Congress shall be sent to the general-secretariat in writing, with a brief explanation, at least 30 days before the date of the Congress .
