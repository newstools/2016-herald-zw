Tendai Rupapa Senior Court Reporter&#8212;A Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (Zimra) information communication technology manager reportedly issued fake vehicle registration particulars to an unsuspecting motorist under the pretext that they were genuine before pocketing more than $2 000, which the motorist had paid to Zimra. Sidney Kunesu (42) is said to have worked in connivance with his alleged accomplice, Mhandu Chigwara (39), who lured motorists to Kunesu promising them hassle-free vehicle registration services.The pair appeared before Harare magistrate Mrs Vongai Muchuchuti-Guwuriro facing charges of fraud.They were granted $50 bail each and remanded to December 19 for trial.Prosecutor Mr Desire Chidanire alleged that on May 4, 2012 at around 10am, Chigwara approached Peter Ndoga and convinced him that he had a relative who worked at ZIMRA who could assist him to register his Toyota Hilux.The following day Chigwara proceeded to Zimra offices in the company of Ndoga and his wife, the court heard.It is the State s case that when they arrived, Chigwara got into the offices and emerged in the company of Kunesu whom he introduced to Ndoga.Kunesu started inspecting Ndoga s car and opened the bonnet before noting the engine number.After the inspection, Kunesu informed Ndoga that registration and duty payment for the vehicle was $2 500 and Ndoga complied.After paying the amount, the couple was ordered to return to Zimra offices the following day, the court heard.It is further alleged that when they returned the following day, they were given a fake vehicle registration book and number plates.After some time, the State alleges that Chigwara collected $175 from Ndoga after misrepresenting that it would cover costs for acquiring a third number plate before he became evasive.The offence came to light after Ndoga took the registration book to the Central Vehicle Registration (CVR) offices for verification.Officials at CVR noticed that the registration book was fake and due to the misrepresentation, the complainant lost $2 675 and nothing was recovered.
