Grace Chingoma Senior Sports ReporterFINALLY, the Mighty Warriors are expected to troop into camp today ahead of the Africa Women Cup of Nations from November 19 to December 3 in Cameroon. The team s preparations were hampered by acute shortage of resources.But an intervention from the Mighty Warriors fundraising committee will see the players report for duty at the ZESA Training Centre today.Mighty Warriors skipper Felistas Figo Muzongondi was putting up a brave face yesterday. As the captain, I can say the nation has let the Mighty Warriors down, she said. They all knew we had qualified well in advance. Now, there is little time left. But as players we always adjust, it has been happening before so we are used to these things, but we will keep on working hard. As you all know we went to Rio, everyone was expecting us to get the results, it was our first time there. As we are going to AFCON most people would be expecting a lot and we are not going there to add numbers, but to achieve. When we are in camp we always encourage each other.
