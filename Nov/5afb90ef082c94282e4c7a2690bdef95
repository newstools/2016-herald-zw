I know when it s time to quit, Bolt told Sky at his home track in Kingston.Bolt hopes to add to his 11 World Championship golds in London next year before quitting the track.The 100m and 200m world record holder admits he sought some high profile advice before deciding to call it a day. Bolt said: I asked Michael Johnson why did you retire when you were on top? You were dominating, no one was beating you . He goes I done everything I need to do in the sport . If you get to a point where there s no drive for you to train then just forget it, just stop or else you re going to start losing races and start embarrassing yourself. Sky Sports.
