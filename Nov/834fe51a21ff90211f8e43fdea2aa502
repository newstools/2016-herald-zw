Narendra ModiNEW DELHI. &#8211; India s main opposition Congress party yesterday attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi s government for causing inconvenience to the people over the demonetisation move, saying it has brought financial anarchy to the country. Speaking during a debate on currency ban in Parliament on the first day of the winter session, Congress leader Anand Sharma urged the government not to tarnish the image of the entire nation by banning currency notes of higher denominations under the garb of curbing the black market. We are a constitutional democracy. Without any notice or warning, the government implemented the rule and made everyone criminal. They have said if we would have announced earlier, it would have helped terrorists, counterfeiters and those with black money, he said in Upper House (Rajya Sabha). It is a fact that our economy runs on agriculture. Does the farmer, who puts food on our table, bring home black money? It s a strange logic. Earlier when notes were recalled, people were given time. Is this law? You have brought financial anarchy to the country, he said.The Congress leader also slammed the government for long queues of people at banks and automated teller machine (ATM) kiosks to withdraw cash or swap old currency notes with new ones. There are people who are taking turns to stand in ATM lines. So many have died standing in line. This government has no compassion. Your government is insensitive, Sharma said, also accusing the government of leaking selectively the information of demonetisation beforehand. &#8211; Xinhua.
