Elita Chikwati Senior Reporter&#8212;The Land Commission should rectify all errors and anomalies in farming areas to allow beneficiaries of the land reform programme to boost agricultural production and ensure food security. This was said by legislators responding to the second reading of the Land Commission Bill in Parliament on Tuesday.The Bill, which was read by Lands and Resettlement Minister Dr Douglas Mombeshora, seeks to provide for the Zimbabwe Land Commission, referred to in Section 296 of the Constitution and for matters pertinent thereto, including the allocation of rights in State land for agricultural purposes, the registration of such rights, the creation and extinction of servitudes over State land, the settlement of persons on such land, the control of the subdivision and lease of land for farming or other purposes, and the limitation of the number and sizes of pieces of land that may be owned by any individual among other things.In response to the Bill, legislators said the commission was a positive development that was going to bring finality to the land reform programme.The legislators said the commission should correct anomalies on land ownership and also ensure there was equitable distribution of the land along gender lines.Lands and Agriculture parliamentary portfolio committee chairman Mr Christopher Chitindi said the commission should address the issue of land tenure.He said some beneficiaries of the land reform were failing to access funding from banks and were failing to produce.He also said the commission should address gender issues pertaining to ownership of land.Chegutu West legislator Cde Dexter Nduna said it was important that the commission addresses multiple farm ownership.He said allowing people to have several farms was duplicating what was the case during the colonial era when the land was in the hands of a few people.Cde Nduna also complained of the corrupt activities by some land officers whom he said were corruptly allocating land.He said transferring corrupt land officers was not the solution as the problem would just be taken to another area. Corrupt land officers should be relieved of their duties. It is not proper to transfer the culprits as they will continue with their corrupt activities, he said.Cde Nduna also expressed concern over land tax. He said farmers should be given at least three seasons before they could start paying land tax.Buhera West Member of Parliament Cde Oliver Mandipaka said the commission should also address the issue of illegal settlements.He noted with concern that people were settling themselves in wetlands . He concurred with Cde Nduna on multiple farm ownership. The commission should ensure we have credible data on farm ownership, so that we do not have imbalances as we had in the past, he said.Norton legislator Mr Temba Mliswa said more people should have access to land, especially the war veterans who fought for the land.He also complained that resettled farmers had 99-year leases and offer letters, but were not accessing loans from banks. White farmers have access to funding when resettled farmers cannot use the lease documents. We should empower the indigenous far- mers. The commission should have authority and power to exercise its powers. Councillors and chiefs should not parcel out land, he said.The legislators agreed that the commission should be independent and be able to deliver.
