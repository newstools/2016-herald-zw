Mr Kennedy ChokudaZvamaida Murwira: Senior ReporterAt least 35 new Members of Parliament elected through by-elections have started taking delivery of their vehicles. Clerk of Parliament Mr Kennedy Chokuda confirmed the development yesterday. We have started providing them with vehicles. We hope that everyone of them would have taken delivery of their vehicles before year end, said Mr Chokuda.He said financial challenges that Treasury had been facing led to the delay in the provision of the vehicles. Legislators are entitled to Ford Ranger off road vehicles on a Parliamentary Vehicle Loan facility, whose value is pegged at $30 000.A legislator can top up should he require a superior make than the Ford Ranger. Some MPs slammed the pace at which vehicles were being distributed. Yes, the facility is now there for use. We have been told to go and take delivery of vehicles of our choice with the supplier. The challenge we are experiencing is that in some instances you go there and you are told that they have run out of stock and one would have to wait again.
