BERLIN. German Chancellor Angela Merkel told her party yesterday she will seek re-election next year, a move likely to be welcomed in many capitals as a sign of stability following poll triumphs for Brexit and Donald Trump. Germany does not have directly set terms for Chancellor, but they expected to maintain the support of the Bundestag (parliament), which has a four-year term.After months of feverish speculation, Merkel said at a meeting of her conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) that she would run for a fourth term, party sources said. Merkel (62), has governed Europe s top economic power, which does not have term limits, since 2005. AFP.&nbsp;
