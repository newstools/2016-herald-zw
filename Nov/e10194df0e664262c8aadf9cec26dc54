The first edition of the fun-filled show was posted last Saturday and incorporated themes on celebrities, corporates, religion, politics and his personal life.The Africa s newest show originated from the television concept by South African funniest comedian Trevor Noah s The Daily Show .Ncube said he has been performing that type of show at live performances but due to its nature and contents it might not be played on local television hence opting for an internet platform. I already have been performing these type of shows on live stage performances and due to the nature and contents of the show it probably will not be screened on our local television stations, Ncube said.Ncube shows his versatile comedy and quick wit in this show reel revealing the need to have a late night satirical news show for the continent.Currently his version has a bias towards Zimbabwe but Ncube states that he intends to perform this style of show all over Africa using his writing and graphics/animation skills to put together content specific to many African countries.Ncube revealed that he feels that the African continent is full of content and it is important that the content produced is able to distill the complexity of Africa into a form the world can consume.At this stage the late night show will be done as a live comedy show in various countries with broadcast discussion happening in various countries to make this a reality.Ncube also said this idea was to film a pilot to show broadcasters abroad that this is a good time to consider late night satirical shows in Africa.This version of Late night With Carl Joshua Ncube features blogger and media practitioner Larry Kwirirayi, the first female animator in Zimbabwe Clair Dongo and Zimbabwean Comedian Doc Vikela.
