Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports ReporterTHE impasse between the Premier Soccer League and regional leaders which led the ZIFA Council to revert to the relegation of four teams from the top-flight league was provoked by disagreements over the funding of the play-offs. A letter written by PSL chief executive, Kenny Ndebele on October 4 is at the heart of the dramatic fallout.The Herald has since learnt that the four regional chairpersons met with the PSL leadership in June this year and an agreement was thrashed out.The league agreed to sponsor the play-offs where two teams, from the four which will top the Division One tables, will qualify for the 2017 Premier League.Two teams would also be relegated from the Premiership.An agreement was also reached that the National Sports Stadium would host the play-offs.But when the PSL said, in a letter last month that they would not finance the play-offs, all hell broke loose. We acknowledge receipt and thank you for your letter dated September 13, 2013, Ndebele wrote to his ZIFA counterpart. Please be advised that the PSL did not offer to sponsor the 2016 PSL promotional play-offs. We proposed and it was agreed that the PSL will organise and run the Promotional play-offs. We are still prepared to organise the promotional play-offs to determine the two teams to join the PSL in 2017. Meanwhile, we attach hereto the draft Competition Rules and Regulations for your personal and approval by the ZIFA Competitions Committee. Sources said PSL boss Peter Dube even had a $65 000 budget for the play-offs.But once the PSL made it clear they would not be able to cover the costs of the play-offs, the regional leaders proposed that they revert to the old format of relegating four teams and promoting four.When the matter was put to vote, the regional leaders easily won.Black Rhinos would have become the first team to gain promotion to the Premier Soccer League after their 2-0 win over Kariba Waves at One Commando on Saturday.Northern Region ResultsGunners 3, ZRP Morris 1; Blue Swallows 1, Craneborne Bullets 1; Golden Valley 1, Chegutu Pirates 0 (abandoned), Black Rhinos 2, Kariba Waves 0; ZRP FC 0, Karoi United 0; Herentals 3, Banket United 0; Shamva 0, Commando Bullets 0; Mushowane Stars 2, Flame Lily 1; Darwin United 2, DStv Rangers 0.Southern Region ResultsZPC Hwange 0, Indhlovu Iyanyathela 0; Black Boots 0, Bantu Rovers 2; Vic Falls Tigers 3, Casmny 0; Technosphere 3, ZRP Hwange 0; Bosso 90 2, Talen Vision 3; Bulawayo Chiefs 1, Amagagasi 0.Central Region ResultsWhawha 0, Tongogara 0; Kwekwe Sables 2, ZRP Gwanda 0; Gweru United 0, Shabanie Mine 2; Jessie Mine 4, ZRP Beitbridge 0; Vumbachikwe 0, Ivan Hoe Mine 2; Chrome Stars 0, MSU 1; FC Platinum 2, ZPC Munyati 1.Eastern Region ResultsAfrica Trust 3, Black Eagles 0; Tenax 4 Gutu 0; FC Mutoko 3, Calvary 0; Masvingo City 3, Melfort 0; Renco Mine 0, Mwenezana 0; Mupandawana 2, Buffaloes 0, Surrey 3, Chibi 0.
