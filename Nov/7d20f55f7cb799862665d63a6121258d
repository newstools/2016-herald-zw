We are doing well in terms of preparations but we are worried about how the match will be handled. We have played Highlanders this season and I was not happy with a number of decisions. There were a lot of questionable decisions that were made against us. The ground is not level when we play against Highlanders. We do not know whether it s a question of the referees being afraid of Highlanders supporters but referees should always be neutral, he said.
