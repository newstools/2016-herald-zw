BERLIN. Borussia Dortmund chief Hans-Joachim Watzke has confirmed that sprint king Usain Bolt will train with the German soccer giants. There had been confusion over whether the Jamaican nine-time Olympic champion was serious about trying his hand at football, but Watzke has revealed it is no joke and not a marketing move . Dortmund and Bolt are both sponsored by the German-based sports goods company Puma, whose president contacted Dortmund to say that Bolt had asked about training with the team. Watzke has welcomed the idea and admits coach Thomas Tuchel is also keen on bringing the fastest man in the world to the club for a training session. We decided this some time ago, Watzke told Kicker. Puma CEO Bjorn Gulden who is member of our board has told us that Usain is highly interested in practising with us. For us that s no problem. Our coach Thomas Tuchel likes the idea as well. AFP.
