George Maponga Masvingo BureauPARENTS here have chipped in with relish to complement Government s School Feeding Scheme targeting thousands of pupils in seven districts in the province following a poor harvest last season. The scheme seeks to tame malnutrition and starvation mainly in rural schools.Government introduced the School Feeding Programme targeting children from Early Childhood Development (ECD) A up to Grade 2 following a nationwide crippling drought.In most districts here, parents have been complementing Government efforts by providing relish in the form of green vegetables or even meat.Masvingo provincial education director Mr Zedious Chitiga confirmed the development yesterday.Mr Chitiga said in some areas some parents were making regular monetary contributions to buy relish for schoolchildren. In almost all the seven districts across Masvingo, we have parents who have been complementing Government by providing relish for their children starting with those in ECD A up to Grade 2, he said. We are very happy that in some cases parents are contributing money that is being used to buy animals like goats to feed school children and this kind of support from parents is very encouraging because they are doing more than just cooking for their children but also seek to improve the quality of food, he added. We also appeal to those who might want to donate relish to feed schoolchildren in our schools to do so especially considering that both parents and Government have been doing something to make sure the feeding programme is a resounding success. There were fears attendance at most schools countrywide was going to drop with most children failing to go to school because of hunger.Government made a swift intervention by introducing a feeding programme targeting mainly children in lower grades who are more vulnerable.
