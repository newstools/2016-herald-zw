From George Maponga in MasvingoThe $4 million electrification of the Tokwe-Mukosi Dam wall has started, paving way for the reservoir to be completed by end of January next year. This is expected to boost the on-going drive to shift towards irrigation in the drought-prone Masvingo Province. The electrification project will see hydro-mechanical fittings being carried out on the outlet valves to enable the mechanical release of water from the dam.It comes after Lowveld sugar producer Tongaat Hulett gave the project a financial lifeline by releasing $6,6 million to the Italian contractor at the dam, Salini Impregilo, which had threatened to halt work demanding payment of arrears from Government.While Salini project manager at Tokwe-Mukosi Mr Urbano Luzi could not be reached for comment, sources at the dam yesterday said it was set for completion next January.Tokwe-Mukosi is now 96 percent complete and sources said outstanding works would not be affected by rains as construction work was now taking place at the final layers of the wall.The dam will start impounding rains that will fall beginning this current rain season.Sources said besides hydro-mechanical fittings at the dam wall outlet gates, outstanding works included finishing the parapet wall (final layer on the dam wall), touch-ups on the right bank spillway, the plunge pool on the downstream side of the dam together with finishes on access roads around and to and from the dam.Zimbabwe National Water Authority project manager at Tokwe-Mukosi, Mr Paul Dengu refused to shed light on progress at the project. Work is going on according to schedule and we are satisfied with the situation on the ground but I cannot disclose the actual details because of protocol, he said.Recently, Environment, Water and Climate Minister Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri revealed that Tokwe-Mukosi was going to be completed this year after Government gave firm assurances that the dam project will be prioritised in the allocation of funds.Government, a few months ago, floated Tokwe-Mukosi bills through the Infrastructural Development Bank of Zimbabwe that raised over $66 million that was used to settle part of the arrears to Salini.Tongaat also chipped in with additional funds that averted work stoppage by the contractor, who had threatened to down tools demanding payment of outstanding balances.Tokwe-Mukosi construction has been dogged by financial problems ever since work started 17 years ago because of illegal sanctions imposed on Zimbabwe by the West.Government is wholly funding the over $255 million project that is expected to transform southern parts of Masvingo into a perennial greenbelt catapulting the province to become the breadbasket of Zimbabwe.The dam, with potential to irrigate over 25 000ha, will also generate over 15 megawatts of electricity, enough to light up the whole of Masvingo.
