Khama BilliatPetros Kausiyo and Eddie ChikamhiSTAR Zimbabwe forward and Mamelodi Sundowns talisman Khama Billiat has once again been rested for the Warriors friendly international against Tanzania with coach Callisto Pasuwa insisting there is need to continue managing one of his key players ahead of the African Cup of Nations finals early next year.The Warriors will host the Taifa Stars at the National Sports Stadium on November 13.But the senior side will resume business a week earlier with a Battle of the Zambezi derby clash against Zambia at the same venue in a night game set for November 4.While Pasuwa is unable to call on his foreign stars for the tie against Chipolopolo, he will be able to use them against Tanzania as that game falls inside the dates for the FIFA calendar.Pasuwa, who will name the locals that will face Chipolopolo this afternoon revealed yesterday that he will once again rest Billiat, arguing that the forward needs to be rested at every opportunity that we can get ahead of the Nations Cup finals.Billiat has been playing non-stop football for 15 months for club and country, playing key roles in helping the Warriors qualify for the Nations Cup finals in Gabon and inspired Sundowns to a maiden Champions League title following their triumph over Egypt s Zamalek in the final.Pasuwa said he had been closely following all his players progress at their respective clubs and felt that Billiat, who was omitted from the Warriors last Nations Cup qualification assignment against Guinea in Conakry in September, deserved another rest . When you look at the way things are with the FIFA Club World Cup also coming in December you can see that we have to rest him once again. It is important to help in managing him so that he can be as fit and as fresh as possible for us when we need him for the more important matches. Just like most of his teammates at Sundowns, Khama has played non-stop football over a year and we have to be really understanding and sympathise with the youngman, Pasuwa said.The Warriors coach also revealed that although he was finalising the side to face Tanzania next week, he had once again kept his options open and extended invitations to the England-based pair of Burnley s Tendai Darikwa and Macauley Bonne who plays for League Two outfit Colchester. I have been calling these players for all our assignments right from the start of the qualifiers, but we have kept on receiving different excuses from the youngsters. My policy is to give a chance to every Zimbabwean and that is why I had also called up Brendon Galloway, but he chose to play for the England Under-21. Darikwa told us he was sorting his wedding, then he said he was divorcing and we will give him another chance to come for the game against Tanzania. Bonne showed commitment by coming for the friendly match we played against Morocco away and he has been trying to sort his passport issues so hopefully he can make it again, Pasuwa said.The coach who is looking to assess more players before decided on his provisional Nations Cup squad is also likely to recall former Highlanders man Bruce Kangwa who is now in Tanzania, Swedish-based Tino Kadewere and big Oscar Machapa who has been starring for Congolese giants AS Vita.But before he looks at the squad to tackle the Taifa Stars, Pasuwa is this afternoon expected to name a side of local to face Chipolopolo which could give a hint of the Premiership players he has in mind.The coach will not be able to call on FC Platinum and Ngezi Platinum players as they will be involved the Chibuku Super Cup final on the day that the Warriors will be playing against Chipolopolo.However, in-form strikers &#8211; Leonard Tsipa of CAPS United and Hwange s Gift Mwene could also be included in the side to face Zambia.Team manager Sharif Mussa yesterday said they would also opt for continuity by considering the local players who were part of the Nations Cup qualifiers, the CHAN and COSAFA tournaments.Mussa said new players who have shown potential in this year s Castle Lager Premiership will also be called in to prove their mettle. The squad will immediately go in camp to begin the preparations for the match. We are still working on it because it (the noticed for the friendly) has come to us a bit late. But tomorrow (today) the coach will announce the squad and, once the names have been announced, we expect to start camp immediately. Of course the concerned players will already have been notified. So that would mean we have Friday whole day and part of Saturday to prepare for the match since it will be played in the evening. Naturally, the squad will be made up mostly of those who took part in the AFCON qualifiers and, of course, those who have shown potential to be part of the national team set-up. Another squad will be selected next week for the Tanzania game with the bulk of the foreign-based players and those local-based who may have impressed will be given another chance. The coaches will keep their eyes open. If the local players do well in those matches, the coaches may probably be forced to consider them when they make their final squad for the AFCON, said Mussa.Dynamos goalkeeper Tatenda Mukuruva, Hardlife Zvirekwi of CAPS United, Donovan Bernard, Marshall Mudehwe, Lawrence Mhlanga, Tafadzwa Kutinyu and Teenage Hadebe have been part of the Warriors campaign in the qualifiers.But there will be no place for injured defender Elisha Muroiwa who picked a knock in his last national team assignment.Muroiwa, who partnered Czech-based Costa Nhamoinesu for most part of the Nations Cup qualifiers, damaged his shin during the COSAFA tournament in Namibia back in June and has struggled to recover.His absence could open the doors for the other players who feel they have a strong case ahead of the tournament. Mussa said the coach will keep his options open.Zimbabwe should expect a good run from the northern neighbours. Zambia are using the match to prepare for a tough 2018 World Cup qualifier against Cameroon on November 12.Chipolopolo who will also play Uganda in a friendly have already resumed preparations for the clash against Cameroon and are expecting to get full value from the Warriors.The 2012 African champions are also scheduled to play the Uganda Cranes next Tuesday while efforts are underway to secure more international friendlies against Gabon and Equatorial Guinea.However, Chipolopolo have encountered injury setbacks on goalkeeper Jacob Banda and four other players who are now likely to miss the trip to Harare.The Zambians are expected in the country today led by their coach Wedson Nyirenda.According to the Zambia Daily Mail, goalkeeper Banda, midfielder Roderick Kabwe, striker Justin Shonga, and defenders Simon Silwimba and Christopher Munthali sat out of the Tuesday morning training session at Lusaka s National Heroes Stadium because of knocks.But assistant coach Aggrey Chiyangi was still impressed by the fitness levels displayed by the rest of his charges. There is a lot of progression. Fitness levels are improving, which means we are moving forward. We are happy with the players response and we are working round the clock to ensure the team is ready, said Chiyangi.
