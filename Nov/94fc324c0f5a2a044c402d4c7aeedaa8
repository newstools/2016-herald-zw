Shadreck MlauziEllina Mhlanga Sports Reporter IT S just a few days before the Africa Women Cup of Nations kick off in Yaound , Cameroon and Mighty Warriors coach Shadreck Mlauzi remains courageous in the face of adversity, insisting they could pull off a surprise despite their poor preparations. The Women s Nations Cup will run from December 19 to December 3. Mlauzi s charges are in action on the opening day when they get their campaign at the finals underway with a showdown against perennial rivals South Africa in a Group A tie.That game will come moments after hosts Cameroon would have played Egypt in another Group A encounter.After facing Banyana Banyana, the Mighty Warriors will then meet Egypt on November 22 before concluding the group matches against Cameroon three days later.Ironically, the Mighty Warriors got a rude awakening on the state of their preparedness when Banyana Banyana thrashed them 3-0 in an international friendly at the National Sports Stadium last Thursday.Mlauzi said while his side was exposed in a number of areas when they lost to South Africa last Thursday, there were also some positives which they would draw from the encounter.The tall and slim gaffer said they were now working on responses ahead of the continental showpiece in Cameroon. There were some concerns to the technical team on the fitness of the players. It stood out in the game against South Africa. It s something we are trying to service through an integrated programme where we are working on improving fitness, technique, tactical and the psychological frame of the players. Some players after the Egypt game went back to their clubs and the fitness really dropped to levels where you wouldn t think it s a national team. So starting again with a competitive match it was always going to be a tall order. The game against Banyana Banyana was their second preparatory match, having played Egypt in September.
