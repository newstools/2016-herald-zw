Court ReporterA 33-year-old man and his father are appearing in court after he allegedly grabbed his estranged wife s BMW X5 vehicle and fraudulently registered it in his father s name. Yosia Jose and his father, Dhaiti Jose (56), are jointly charged with Obert Bote (32) and Wonder Mereki (44). The quartet is facing fraud charges and is represented by Mr Admire Rubaya. In his defence, Yosia said he bought the vehicle for the complainant, Elizabeth Mbaraidzo, who was his long- time girlfriend. Later, she requested to sell the vehicle back to him and he agreed to buy it for his father and gave her a Jaguar XF plus $30 000, said Mr Rubaya. She is a bitter woman after failing to secure his hand in marriage. She has since filed for divorce at the High Court and listed the car as matrimonial property subject to shar- ing. These are purely malicious allegations peddled by the complainant who wants to unfairly get back a vehicle she sold to spite him. In her testimony, Mbaraidzo told the court that her former husband was a gold dealer. He took away the BMW and went to Shamva where he started staying with another woman, she said. I phoned him several times trying to resolve our marital problems to no avail and I asked him to return my vehicle. I reported the matter to the police but nothing materialised. I later saw the vehicle with new a registration number.Prosecuting, Mrs Idah Mateke-Maromo alleged that on May 7, last year, Yosia created a fake agreement of sale in favour of his father and forged Mbaraidzo s signature. On May 11, 2015 a fake affidavit purporting that Dhaiti purchased the vehicle from Mbaraidzo was created, it is alleged. Mbaraidzo lost $60 000 and nothing was recovered.
