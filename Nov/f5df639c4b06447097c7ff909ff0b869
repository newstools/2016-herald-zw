Walter Nyamukondiwa Chinhoyi Bureau&#8212;Zanu-PF youths have thrown their weight behind the adoption of bond notes saying the measure should be complemented by zero tolerance to corruption and factionalism, if the country is to move forward. The party youths said the twin scourge of corruption and factionalism should be eradicated to ensure harmony in the party and development in the country.In resolutions at the Mashonaland West provincial youth inter-district conference in Chinhoyi yesterday, the youths said culprits fingered in corruption should be brought to book.The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe will soon introduce bond notes to incentivise exporters and also ameliorate liquidity challenges caused by excessive outflow of money particularly the United States dollar. As the youths, we want to say corruption should not be tolerated and that means culprits should be punished. Then, there is the issue of factionalism, which we may choose to ignore, but it s felt even at cell level, said provincial youth political commissar Cde Admire Musandu.The youths also welcomed the introduction of bond notes as a medium of exchange.In coming up with resolutions, the youths were divided into thematic committees addressing the state of the economy, the party Zanu-PF and youth affairs among others.The resolutions will feed into the national resolutions to be presented at the Zanu-PF Annual People s Conference in Masvingo next month.Youths also reaffirmed their indisputable support for President Mugabe as the party s sole candidate for the 2018 elections.The guest of honour at the conference, Cde Tungamirai Mutonhodza, who is also national secretary for security in the Youth League said resolutions should be futuristic in nature. Our resolutions should also take into account future generations because, very soon, we will no longer be youths. Zanu-PF as a party, should be stronger in 2018 than it is now, said Cde Mutonhodza.The event was attended by Mashonaland West provincial chairman Cde Ephraim Chengeta, the secretary for administration Cde Simbarashe Ziyambi, members of the youth executive and youth representatives from the seven administrative districts in the province.
