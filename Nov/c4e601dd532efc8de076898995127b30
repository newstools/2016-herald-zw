LONDON. &#8211; Manchester City, buoyed by the return of Yaya Toure, will look to seal a spot in the Champions League soccer knockout stage when they travel to Borussia Moenchengladbach tonight to play a team struggling for form. Toure, banned by coach Pep Guardiola following comments by his agent about the manager, returned from a three-month exile to score both goals in City s 2-1 Premier League win at Crystal Palace on Saturday. Guardiola s decision to restore the Ivorian has further boosted spirits, already high with the team just a point behind leaders Chelsea in the English Premier League. His personality and his quality are there to see, Guardiola said. He can play many positions. We now have one more man that can help us achieve our targets this season. With this intensity, we re going to play in the Champions League, said the Spaniard, whose team will advance with a win or a draw. &#8211; Reuters.
