Tedious Manyepo Sports ReporterBLACK Rhinos goalkeeper Herbert Rusawo is widely tipped to bag the Northern Region Division One Soccer Star of the Year accolade after he inspired his side to the region s championship that has left them on the threshold of a return to the Premiership. Rhinos will now have to await the outcome of a stand-off between ZIFA and the Premier Soccer League to know if they will get an automatic ticket to the top-flight or would as previously arranged, face other regional champions in the play-offs. This Saturday, a panel of selectors including coaches, club captains and football writers will convene to choose the 11 stars from the region who gave a good account of themselves in the current season.Chauya Chipembere have proven too good for their opponents snatching the championship with two games to spare.But the soldiers were not as invincible as it may sound as they even endured a lengthy spell without scoring a goal.However, they had goalkeeper Rusawo to thank as he kept their campaign alive with some man of the match performances.The 27-year old who also won the Goalkeeper of the Year accolade in the Premiership in 2013 despite his team s demotion after keeping 13 clean sheets has stood tall in goals for Black Rhinos, keeping an incredible 21 clean sheets in 32 games.He has been voted man-of-the-match for 10 games where his team s defenders were literally off colour leaving him at the mess of opponents strikers but somehow managed to contain the pressure. He is actually one of the best goalkeepers in the country. Rusawo (Herbert) is one of the main reason why we managed to win the championship. I am very much comfortable when he is in goals for the team, said his coach Stanford Stix Mtizwa.The Northern Region Soccer Star will get a car from World Navi who have sponsored the accolade for some years now.Rusawo will, however, have to contend with stiff competition from some players who have been impressive throughout the season who include his captain, Bruce Homora, striker Vincent Mhandu as well as the Herentals pair of Blessing Majarira and Innocent Benza.Ngezi Platinum s Evans Katema won the gong last year after he had played an influential role in steering the miners to Premiership promotion.
