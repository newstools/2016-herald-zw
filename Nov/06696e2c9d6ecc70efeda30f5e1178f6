We are happy with the way this year s festival has gone. It was a double event since it also had the Jerusarema-Mbende Festival that attracted many followers. Performers of various ages have shown their skill and we can proudly say we have serious arts talent in this province, said Maziwa. School children that participated in Mbende festival were encouraged to consider taking art as a profession because most of them have the confidence and the talent. Art is one way to safeguard our heritage and we are proud to be associated with cultural preservation through this festival. He said tomorrow s event is an all-night affair that will start at 6pm and all musicians have confirmed their participation and promised a memorable event.It will be a mixture of genres with Winky D serving dancehall followers while Moyo and Somanje are likely to take elders down memory lane when they play their fathers tracks.Chipfumo will solidify the event with his prowess and experience.
