Nyemudzai Kakore Herald CorrespondentEnvironment, Water and Climate Minister Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri has called for a paradigm shift in addressing water-related disasters in Africa as this has a direct correlation with the region s agro-based economies. Officially opening a workshop on training and knowledge transfer on Africa Drought Monitoring Systems for Southern African countries in Harare, Minister Muchinguri said countries in the region should be prepared for extreme weather events such as El Nino which is associated with droughts in Southern Africa as well La Nina which brings more rains and flooding in the region.In a speech read on her behalf by director of water resources planning and management Engineer Tinayeshe Mutazu, Minister Muchinguri-Kashiri said the SADC region needed to take a proactive approach by moving from crisis management to risk mitigation. Sub-Saharan Africa is vulnerable to climate variability and change and we therefore need to develop adaptation and mitigation strategies in order to minimise the negative impacts of droughts and floods which, as we are now experiencing, are becoming a recurrent phenomenon, she said. Experts predict that with the setting in of the climate change phenomenon, it is very likely that the frequency, the intensity and extension of hydrological extremes (floods and droughts) will increase. This means that we will have to face more and more floods and droughts in years to come. Minister Muchinguri-Kashiri said there was a need to understand the causes and characteristics of drought and flood events. She said putting in place a good monitoring, forecasting and early warning system would provide accurate information.University of Zimbabwe Vice Chancellor, Professor Levi Nyagura said UZ research policy recognises that the existing gaps that underpin national and regional development challenges cannot be adequately addressed without the input of institutions of higher learning and research.He said the workshop came at an opportune time when the University has committed itself to develop Geographic Information Science and Earth Observation as its key areas of excellence.The workshop is being attended by UNESCO regional director Professor Hubert Gijzen, SADC Water Division, Water Policy Strategist, Dr Kenneth Msibi, University of Princeton and Southampton representatives among other delegates.
