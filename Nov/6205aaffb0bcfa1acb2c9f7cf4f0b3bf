ADELAIDE. &#8211; South Africa have accused an Australian TV station of harassing cricket captain Faf du Plessis after a reporter was involved in a physical confrontation with a team security guard at Adelaide Airport yesterday. Du Plessis has been charged with ball-tampering by the International Cricket Council (ICC) during the second test in Hobart, which South Africa won to clinch the series with a match to spare.A statement from team manager Mohammed Moosajee yesterday said the Australian media, and Channel 9 in particular, had been advised that Du Plessis could not comment on the matter until a hearing was held.Moosajee said the South Africans were therefore disappointed that Channel 9 had blatantly ignored their media protocol both at the team hotel in Melbourne over the weekend and when the squad arrived at Adelaide airport yesterday.TV pictures showed a Channel 9 reporter trying to push his way past South Africa officials and players to ask Du Plessis for comment, as one of his colleagues had in Melbourne over the weekend. &#8211; Reuters.
