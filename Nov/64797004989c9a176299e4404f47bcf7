Faith Mutema Sports ReporterZIMBABWE S Mighty Warriors will make a rare appearance at Barbourfields when they host perennial rivals South Africa on November 10. Both the Mighty Warriors and Banyan Banyana are fine tuning their African Women s Cup of Nations finals campaigns in Cameroon. The Mighty Warriors usually play their assignments at Rufaro.With the Warriors also engaged in friendly matches during the same time in the capital, ZIFA have switched the Mighty Warriors to Barbourfields.However, in a worrying development the Mighty Warriors are still to get into camp although indications were that coach Shadreck Mlauzi s charges could begin their preparations today at the ZESA Training Centre in Harare.Mhlauzi who seems to have had to live the frustration of having his programme constantly disrupted by lack of adequate resources, welcomed the move by ZIFA to arrange the friendly match.ZIFA president Philip Chiyangwa who was in Johannesburg earlier this week sealed the warm up match following discussions with the South African Football Association officials.And Mlauzi said he would grab any opportunity of a friendly match with both hands. We have to make the most out of this friendly. The challenge is that most women associations have little or no interests in maintaining women s fitness, so we are hoping the match with Banyana Banyana will give the team the focus they need for the national games. It is going to be a challenge since we lacked preparation due to shortage of resources and time has taken the best out of us, said Mlauzi.The delay in preparation for the team led to the team s committee hosting a fund-raising dinner at Rainbow Towers last night. ZIFA spokesperson Xolisani Gwesela said there are going to organise other matches prior to the Women s Cup of Nations finals The dates are yet to be set but the friendly matches are to make up for the time the team has not been training, said Gwesela said.
