He has performed at the venue before and displayed outstanding stage choreography.The Dherira hit-maker has joined the list of busiest musicians in the country and tomorrow s schedule will once again test his strength in the midst of mounting work pressure.But the musician usually lives up to any occasion and his recent performance at a packed stadium in Glendale spoke volumes about his capacity. Muridzo s manager said they have been doing their best to up their game as the demand for their shows grows fast. We are doing well. We are now used to the busy schedules and it is not a problem at all to have two performances on a single day. It is easier in this case because at Chipaz s function we will have a short slot while the rest of the night we will be at Las Vegas where the real party takes place, he said.While other musicians are retreating to remote parts of the country due to competition in Harare, Muridzo is contesting for space with big names in the industry.Club Las Vegas has hosted big names like Oliver Mtukudzi, Alick Macheso, Jah Prayzah and Suluman Chimbetu.
