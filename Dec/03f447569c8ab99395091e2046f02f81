MADRID. Real Madrid captain Sergio Ramos again came to his side s rescue as they snatched a dramatic 3-2 victory over Deportivo La Coruna on Saturday to keep Zinedine Zidane s side six points clear at the top of the Spanish La Liga soccer table and set a club record 35 games unbeaten.Ramos, the scorer of Real s 90th-minute equaliser last week against Barcelona, headed in Toni Kroos corner in the 93rd minute to complete a stunning turnaround after former Real forward Joselu threatened to unravel the unbeaten run.Joselu struck twice in the space of two minutes to cancel out Alvaro Morata s stunning second-half strike in the 63rd minute and gave Deportivo a shock 2-1 lead in the 65th by knocking in a low cross from Florin Andone.Real youngster Mariano Diaz scored his first league goal to level in the 88th and preserve the unbeaten run but yet again Ramos had the final say. When you fight until the end things go your way. They penalised our errors but in the end when you work hard you get results, said Ramos. I m happy that I keep scoring goals and above all we keep completing our objectives. Zidane, who rested several players, including Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema, was also without Gareth Bale, who has an ankle injury &#8212; only the second time since the Welshman joined that Real have been without any of their famous BBC strike force of Bale, Benzema and Ronaldo for a league game.The win keeps them top of La Liga on 37 points, six clear of nearest challengers Barcelona, who won 3-0 at Osasuna thanks to two second-half strikes from talisman Lionel Messi and an opener from Luis Suarez.Midfield maestro Luka Modric was also rested for the game, and Real struggled to control an end-to-end first half, which saw Deportivo s Celso Borges hit the post and Real s Colombian playmaker James Rodriguez spurn a glorious chance to put the home side ahead.Morata opened the scoring with a wonderful curled shot from outside the area but Joselu, his old strike partner in Real s reserve team, quickly put Deportivo level by capitalising after Casemiro was dispossessed by Andone.
