NELSON. Neil Broom s maiden century and the self-belief of Kane Williamson gave New Zealand a 67-run victory over Bangladesh to take the second one-day international cricket match and the series in Nelson yesterday. Bangladesh suffered a dramatic meltdown when they were cruising towards what should have been a comfortable victory after Broom s unbeaten 109 was the only significant score in New Zealand s 251.The tourists reached 104 for one in the 23rd over and were all out for 184 by the 43rd, losing their last nine wickets for 80 runs.The win, following New Zealand s 77-run victory in the first match, gives the home side an unbeatable 2-0 lead with one match remaining, also in Nelson, tomorrow.With New Zealand s frontline bowlers struggling for consistency at the start of the Bangladesh innings, skipper and part-time spinner Williamson put himself into the attack as the seventh bowler and claimed three for 22 with his looping off-breaks.Williamson described it as a satisfying outcome given the pressure New Zealand were under.
