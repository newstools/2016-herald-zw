Blessing Malinganiza Herald Reporter&#8212; Harare City Council will shut down Morton Jaffray Water Treatment Plant over the weekend to allow critical maintenance work at the plant and along the main lines. Customers have been encouraged to store enough water and use it wisely.They have also been persuaded to harvest rain water for domestic use during this period. In a statement yesterday, council spokesperson Mr Michael Chideme, said the shutdown would allow critical maintenance work at Morton Jaffray and along the main lines. Harare City Council advises its esteemed water customers of the complete shutdown of the Morton Jaffray Water Treatment Plant from today at 2200 hours up to Sunday December 18 at 0600 hours, said Mr Chideme. Seventy percent of the installations currently underway at Morton Jaffray Water Plant have already been completed. We expect to complete the on-going installation of new plant and equipment under the Morton Jaffray renewal programme during the shutdown. The main aim of the renewal programme underway at Morton Jaffray is to improve water delivery and availability in the city. Morton Jaffray Water Plant supplies and delivers water to the greater part of Harare while other parts of the city rely on Prince Edward Water Treatment Plant.The city, however, recently expressed concern over the shrinking supply of water in Harare with the dam supplying Prince Edward reported to be almost dry.Mr Chideme recently confirmed that despite the inroads made at Morton Jaffray with the current refurbishment of the water treatment plant, they might not be able to supply water as the city continues to grow.
