MshozaJohannesburg. &#8211; Mshoza s love for cosmetic surgery isn t news but 2016 saw the songbird take things to a whole new level.Earlier this year Mshoza found herself making headlines after a video of her undergoing a massive transformation to look like Nicki Minaj. The surgery which was dubbed the Michael Jackson procedure saw Mshoza undergo a series of treatments which included skin lightening body sculpting botox and fillers.The entire surgery was documented by MTV Base Africa.Mshoza was widely ridiculed by social media users who accused her of being ashamed of being black.Pictures of Mshoza from a few years ago also started circulating as people compared her dramatic skin colour transformation and the way her entire face has changed over the years.Despite drawing an incredible amount of criticism over her love for skin-lightening Mshoza has often hit back at the hate saying that people must just accept her.The songstress has never been one to mince her words and has said in numerous interviews that changing her appearance has nothing to do with self-hate or being ashamed of being black .Instead Mshoza has recently revealed that her dramatic transformation is because of a skin condition that she s been fighting.But one thing is for sure Mshoza has no time for you haters. I will do another procedure. It s my body. If I wake up and feel like it I will. If I feel like my legs are not straight I ll do it. It s my body I decide as I go she told TshisaLIVE-TshizaLive.
