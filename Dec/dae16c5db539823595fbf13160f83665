Ellina Mhlanga Sports Reporter NEWLY-ELECTED Zimbabwe Boxing Federation president Jim Mpalale believes grassroot sport development is the way to go as he begins his four-year term of office. Mpalale was elected into office together with three other members on Saturday in Harare at the Sports Commission s headquarters at the National Sports Stadium.They take over from the Lovemore Malianga-led executive that was suspended by the Sports Commission for non-compliance.The president s post was contested by two candidates and Mpalale got 15 votes to beat Festus Dumbu, who got five. It is quite a big challenge because boxing as it is now, because of (Charles) Manyuchi s success, its way up there and we need to maintain that. We need to churn out more champions at amateur level so that we are able to feed into professional boxing. We want to have a situation where we have more champions in each category and also to spread the sport to grassroot especially in schools. This is where the talent is, said Mpalale.A headmaster by profession, he said they are looking at increasing participation by provinces at the National Youth Games held annually as part of their development programme.He will be deputised by Isaac Gora, who won unopposed. Arvin Mathe comes in as the secretary-general and Eireen Mahleka in the new treasurer.They were also unopposed.The Mpalale-led executive is expected to meet with the Sports Commission for an induction before they convene their first meeting to come up with their programme for 2017. We are going to have our meeting on the first or second week of January. But before that we have a meeting with the SRC to map the way forward and look at the nitty-gritty of the sport, Mpalale.Sports Commission development manager, Charity Nyamayedenga, said they are going to meet soon with the new ZBF leadership.
