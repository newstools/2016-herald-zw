ADDIS ABABA. Ethiopia says it is releasing nearly 10 000 people detained under its ongoing state of emergency but plans to charge almost 2 500 others accused of destabilising the country. Deputy government spokesperson Zadig Abraha told The Associated Press that 9 800 people were to be freed yesterday. They have been given lots of trainings . . . so that they won t be part of the destructive trend that we have seen in the past. The East African country declared the state of emergency in October after nearly a year of anti-government protests.Most of the detainees are from the restive Oromia and Amhara regions.Zadig says Ethiopia has seen a tremendous change in the peace and security under the state of emergency, which is to end in April.
