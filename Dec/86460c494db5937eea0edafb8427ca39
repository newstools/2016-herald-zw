Herald Reporter A group of runners who include 30 students from the Peterhouse Group of Schools, will this month take part in a marathon across Zimbabwe to raise funds for the conservation of African Wild Dogs also known as Painted Dogs that are threatened by extinction.In a statement, the Painted Dog Conservation Organisation said the run will start at Chilo Gorge in Gonarezhou on December 11 and will finish in Victoria Falls on December 17, passing through Masvingo and Bulawayo along the way.Participants will cover over 1 000 kilometres from east to west, with each person running the equivalent of a half marathon every day for seven days. ln 1996, a group of schoolboys set off on a 1 000km run across Zimbabwe to raise funds for the conservation of African Wild Dogs. The boys completed the run, generated significant interest in an animal not commonly known to be endangered and raised a staggering $47,000 to support conservation efforts. Those boys are now men. And in December 2016, they will reunite to celebrate the 20-year anniversary of the event by completing another run. The Painted Dog Conservation Anti-Poaching Unit will complete the team. The intent will be the same to do something meaningful to protect one of Africa&#8217;s most iconic animals. A forgotten species. A species that doesn&#8217;t generate the same attention as rhinos or elephants, yet is equally as important, reads the statement.Painted Dogs are unique to Africa and they are among the continent&#8217;s most endangered species. It is estimated that less than 7 000 remain in the wild with the population in Zimbabwe being one of the last strongholds of the species.The Painted Dog Conservation Organisation was formed by Cathrine Kanhema-Blinston, Jerry Gotora, Tsitsi Sekeramayi, Dr Gibson Mandishona and Chief Dingani Nelukoba of Dete.
