Innocent Ruwende Municipal Reporter Harare City Council has raised over $2,3 million from informal sector businesses like markets, home industries, overnight guarded car parks and buses among others. According to recent minutes of the informal sector committee, acting director of housing and social development Retired Major Matthew Marara reported on revenue collected from informal sector projects as from January 2016 to November 11, 2016. The acting director of housing and social development (Rtd Maj Marara) reported that a total amount of $2 329 008 had been generated and collected from the informal sector projects from January 1 to November 11, 2016. The informal sector comprised of five projects, markets, home industries, overnight guarded car parks, buses, and EcoCash booths. There are about 20 200 informal traders in various trades in Greater Harare, reads the minutes.Rtd Maj Marara said council was collecting revenue from informal traders, commuter omnibuses and buses.Collections, he said, were subdued due to the prevailing economic environment and enforcement issues and that there was a need for the identification of more trading sites in line with the informal sector policy.Arising from discussions, the committee expressed concern over Mbare Member of Parliament Tendai Savanhu whom councillors accused of inciting residents not to pay rentals for markets as well as rentals and rates for houses. It was the committee s view that there was need for council s top management to engage the relevant MP and make him aware of the consequences of his actions and request him to stay out of council business, read the minutes.Council then resolved that acting town clerk Mrs Josephine Ncube should engage Local Government, Public Works and National Housing Minister Saviour Kasukuwere to warn MP Savanhu on the consequences of his actions.Recently Harare ditched plans to take over the running of overnight guarded car parks after a cost benefit analysis showed this would be unprofitable to council. Harare intended to take over the guarded car parks in efforts to boost revenue streams. Rtd Maj Marara tabled findings of a cost benefit analysis he carried out on the proposed takeover.The operation and maintenance of overnight guarded car parks is currently done by individuals who are on a monthly payment system. Car parks operate on yearly renewable leases and in the current set up council does not incur operating costs but simply collects revenue.
