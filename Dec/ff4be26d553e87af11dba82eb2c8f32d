BRISBANE. &#8211; Australia captain Steve Smith shone in the Gabba floodlights with a sparkling century to put Australia in a commanding position on day one of the first Test cricket against Pakistan yesterday. Smith s unbeaten 110 drove Australia to 288 for three at stumps, as Pakistan s bowlers toiled on a hot day in the field and enjoyed little relief in the cool of the evening as the pink ball made its Brisbane debut.Peter Handscomb, who shared in an unbroken 137-run partnership with Smith, was 64 not out with Australia well placed to build a big first innings total on day two. You d take 3-288 any day of the week, said Smith. They re all special, I love getting hundreds, I love batting out here at the Gabba. Smith won the toss and sent his team in to bat on a wicket that offered little for the bowlers until the new ball showed some movement late in the final session.Misbah-ul-Haq s side took two quick wickets before tea to have the match delicately poised at 75-2 but Smith and rookie opener Matt Renshaw (71) steadied the home side with a 76-run partnership.Middle order batsman Handscomb struck his second half-century to continue his positive start after his debut against South Africa in the day-night dead rubber in Adelaide.Smith was dropped on 53 in the final over before the dinner break, with part-time spinner Azhar Ali coaxing an edge to Sarfraz Ahmed but the wicketkeeper put it down. - AFP.
