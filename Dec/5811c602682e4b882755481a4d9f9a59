Herald Reporter Eight armed robbers raided a service station in Kadoma last week and got away with over $18 000 and other valuable goods. This comes as police continue to urge business people to bank cash regularly to avoid losses as a result of robberies. No arrests have been made and investigations are still in progress. It is alleged that the eight, who were armed with machetes and knobkerries went to the service station around midnight and manhandled a security guard.They then demanded keys and gained entry into some of the offices at the service station where they managed to unlock the safe and took away the cash.
