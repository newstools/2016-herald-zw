JOHANNESBURG. Years after retiring from the game, former Nigeria international Nwankwo Kanu has been named in the list of top 50 soccer legends around the world. The International Federation of Football History and Statistics (IFFHS) listed the former Ajax Amsterdam star in a 50-man group that has some illustrious football legends with Kanu, the only Nigerian on the list.Amazingly, the list did not feature the likes of Cubilas from Peru, Lato and Deyna from Poland, Luis Suarez from Spain, Leonidas from Brazil, Hidekuti from Hungary s legendary 1954 team and Fritz Walters, Germany s 1954 captain. Eye raising exclusions also included Bobby Moore and Uwe Seeler, who played in four World Cups. Notable legends on the list did include Edson Arantes do Nascimento (Pele) and Diego Armando Maradona, two players, who are considered as the best ever seen.Kanu s inclusion will come as no surprise as the former Super Eagles captain has earned his stripes over 17 years of professional football which saw him win the Uefa Champions League, the Olympic Games gold medal in football, the English Premier League title, the FA Cup among others.
