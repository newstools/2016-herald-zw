Almost ChristmasCool Reloaded with Swagga T&#8212;Christmas Day is only a week away and I hope you are excited and getting ready. The good thing is Santa Claus is already in town and we pray he visits with those goodies, if not please tell your mama to clear the chimney as that is the road he mostly uses. If you hear the jingle bell clinking Ho-ho-ho then you know you re one of the luckiest teens alive.Remember Christmas colours are green but that does not mean wear them all the time as you might end up looking like an elf.I suggest you leave that for the Christmas tree and decorations.If you love Christmas then you should be organised. It is now a thing of the past, crying for new clothes as the year passes, you are already wearing trendy clothes.I know there are some disadvantaged children who can only get new clothes this season, please spare a thought for them.Like swag is also about love, let s share the clothes we have and remember you put a smile on someone s face, when you give them something.Still in the spirit of green and red theme, our movie of the week is Almost Christmas and hey it is already showing by the Ster Kinekor, Sam Levy Village and Westgate.Parents need to know that Almost Christmas is an all-star ensemble holiday movie which stars Danny Glover, Gabrielle Union, Jessie T. Usher and Romany Malco among others.It is about a dysfunctional family celebrating their first Christmas after a sad loss. Although it centres on a family with three school-aged grandchildren, it s not really for kids some might say but still, in the end the movie offers a positive message about forgiveness, family closeness, and the power of a strong legacy.The talented all-star cast particularly Smoove and Mo Nique makes this standard-issue dysfunctional-family holiday comedy worth watching.Although Almost Christmas storyline is rather thin Dad is secretly selling the house, Evan is taking painkillers and Lonnie is a philanderer!The actors play their roles so well that viewers will be invested in the feel-good happy-holidays outcome.Christmas movies in general tend to be pretty predictable, but that doesn t make them any less entertaining.According to Common Sense Media, there s enough in director David E. Talbert s story that s poignant and sweet that moviegoers will overlook the story s more formulaic aspects. Plus, Mo Nique is hilarious as the wig-swapping, name-dropping Aunt May, who s performed for Mick Jagger and Chaka Khan and enjoys imparting all of her wisdom to Walter and her nieces and nephews.She and Smoove contribute the majority of the movie s humour. His character enjoys touting his brief time as a Seattle Supersonic (even though he then ended up playing ball in Croatia and is far from a household name).The movie s sibling dynamics feel authentic, with a relatable blend of rivalry, nostalgia, and dependence. And Glover s quest to perfect his wife s signature dish will pull at anyone s heart-string.Enjoy the weekend and make sure you won t do want your CLS team don t do.Be happy this Christmas and remember make mama proud again this holiday by doing household chores.
