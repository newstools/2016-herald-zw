Both of them received sutures on deep cuts and are recovering at Kapane Clinic.Villagers suspected the buffalo strayed from the Hwange National Park.Tsholotsho Campfire s Natural Resources assistant executive officer, Mr Mthokozisi Dlodlo said a team had been deployed to the ground on Sunday and had managed to put down the buffalo on Tuesday morning. We received a report of a solitary buffalo which attacked a villager on Sunday. We immediately deployed a team of game rangers to conduct a patrol and shoot it before it injured more or even killed people. After an intense search they found it and killed it. We had no option as a solitary buffalo is usually dangerous and was bound to cause more human-wildlife conflict in the community, said Mr Dlodlo.Tsholotsho Rural District Council s Chief Executive Officer, Mr Themba Moyo said the incidents happened in ward 3, where two buffaloes have been shot this year to reduce human-wildlife conflict.
