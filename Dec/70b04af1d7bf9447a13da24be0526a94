WELLINGTON. &#8211; Captain Kieran Read is likely to become the first All Black to earn more than $1 million per season after New Zealand Rugby agreed a major boost in salaries under a collective agreement with its Players Association. In a move detailed yesterday, NZR has agreed to boost its player payment pool by $70 million from $120 million to $190 million over the next three years.The boost recognises increases in sponsorship and broadcast revenue, including an estimated $40 million windfall from next year s British and Irish Lions Tour, and is designed to protect New Zealand s leading players from raids by overseas clubs.Read comes off contract next year and is poised to announce a new deal through the 2019 Rugby World Cup which could take him through the $1 million barrier. - AFP.
