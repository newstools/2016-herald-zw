From George Maponga in MasvingoThe venue of the Zanu-PF 16th Annual National People s Conference to be held at the Masvingo Showgrounds next week is almost ready, with workmen now putting final touches on structures. The ruling party s indaba will run from the 13 to 17 December at the showgrounds located near the Masvingo-Harare Highway and an estimated 5 000 delegates are expected to attend.All hotels, lodges and guest houses in and around Masvinvgo City have since been fully booked for the conference that will be held under the theme Moving with Zim-Asset in Peace and Unity . Zanu-PF secretary for administration Dr Ignatius Chombo last Friday toured the conference venue and expressed satisfaction with the ground that has been covered.Dr Chombo said the ruling party was now focusing on crafting content to be discussed at the indaba to instil hope among Zimbabweans by providing lasting solutions to economic problems. When The Herald visited the conference venue yesterday, workmen were busy erecting tents that will house VIP guests together with kitchens for all the 10 Zanu-PF provinces.Workers were also putting final touches on one of the toilets being constructed by Friends of Dr Joshua Mqabuko Nkomo Trust. Zanu-PF acting Masvingo provincial chairman Cde Amasa Nhenjana, yesterday said everything was now in place. We are now making final touches to our preparations, especially at the venue where the only outstanding work is finishing the pitching up of the main tent, VIP tent together with kitchens for all the provinces, the rest of the work is now complete, he said. Upgrading work on the ground at the venue together with access roads that will be used by both the VIP guests and other delegates have also been completed and work on one outstanding toilet is almost done. The few toilets that were built will complement the 147 mobile toilets that will be used during the conference, he added.Cde Nhenjana said Masvingo City Council had already connected running water at the venue, adding that five new boreholes were drilled. As for donations, we have received most of the things that were pledged and our hope is that those individuals and companies that have not yet made good on their pledges will be doing so in the coming few days, otherwise we now have almost everything that we need to host a very successful conference, added Cde Nhenjana.Masvingo managed to raise more than 55 cattle to feed delegates during the indaba, together with nearly $60 000 in cash donated by companies and individuals in the province.The two Zanu-PF second secretaries and State Vice Presidents Cdes Emmerson Mnangagwa and Phelekezela Mphoko are expected to tour the venue this week to ensure everything is in place.Besides hotels, lodges and guest houses, delegates to the Zanu-PF conference will also be housed at colleges, universities and schools in and around Masvingo, most of which have already received funding from the ruling party to upgrade their facilities.Most Masvingo residents were expecting to cash in on the conference by renting out their houses to some of the delegates who would have failed to secure accommodation. Masvingo last hosted the Zanu-PF National Annual People s Conference at Masvingo Teachers College in 2003.Last year s conference was held in Victoria Falls, Matabeleland North Province.
