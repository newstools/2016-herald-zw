ZIFA president Philip ChiyangwaTedious Manyepo Sports Reporter THE Zimbabwe National Soccer Supporters Association have hailed the landmark election of ZIFA president Philip Chiyangwa to the Council of Southern Africa Football Association s Praesidium, saying the development will leave Zimbabwe s football strategically positioned to lure more international partners. Chiyangwa assumed the regional bloc s leadership position unopposed after his only contender, Danny Jordan of South Africa, withdrew just hours before the elections held at Sun City in South Africa last Saturday. Outgoing COSAFA president, Suketu Patel of the Seychelles, who had been at the helm of the organisation in the last decade, did not seek re-election.And the ZNSSA believe Chiyangwa s new role will open a fresh chapter in the development of football in this country.In an interview with The Herald yesterday, the ZNSSA s founding father Eddie Mboma Nyatanga, who together with his colleagues did not sleep on the eve of the COSAFA elections trying to ensure there were no any slip ups ahead of the vote on Saturday, congratulated Chiyangwa and reckoned Zimbabwean football will never be the same again. On behalf of the Zimbabwe National Soccer Supporters Association, I would like to congratulate ZIFA president, Dr Philip Chiyangwa for being elected the new president of the Council of Southern Africa Football Association. He has indeed done us proud and raised high the Zimbabwean flag. No Zimbabwean has ever held that position before, It is good news for Zimbabwe and international sponsors will likely consider investing in a country with regional football leadership, he said.Nyatanga said his association will continue supporting Chiyangwa even when he considers to go for CAF or FIFA leadership positions. We will continue to rally behind Chiyangwa and we wish to see football develop in this country under his leadership. We say to him that the sky is the limit and he should even aim for the CAF and even the FIFA seats, Nyatanga said.
