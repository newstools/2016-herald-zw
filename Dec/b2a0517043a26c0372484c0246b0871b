George Maponga in Masvingo&#8212;Government has started mobilising new state-of-the-art irrigation equipment to support hybrid seed producers at the 300-hectare Fuve-Panganai Irrigation Scheme in Zaka for them to expand seed exports in the Sadc region. Irrigation farmers at Fuve-Panganai are producing hybrid maize and sugar beans seed under Zimbabwe Super-Seeds and they have already made inroads in the regional market where they are exporting part of their produce to Malawi and Zambia.Zaka Super Seeds produce nearly 150 tonnes of maize and sugar beans seed most of which is sold on the local market while the remainder is exported.The farmers at Fuve-Panganai have been battling to raise enough capital to secure modern irrigation equipment and also roll out a mechanisation programme to improve productivity.Deputy Minister of Agriculture, Mechanisation and Irrigation Development responsible for Cropping Davis Marapira, yesterday said Government had already started mechanisation of Fuve-Panganai scheme to improve productivity by Zimbabwe Super Seeds.He said plans were at an advanced stage to secure centre-pivots for the irrigation scheme, which was planning to double seed output to nearly 300 tonnes next year. As Government, we are very happy with the work that is being done by Zimbabwe Super Seeds, which has been producing hybrid maize and sugar beans seed with some being sold on the local market while part of its was exported in the Sadc region, earning the country foreign currency, he said. The farmers at Fuve-Panganai will get assistance to mechanise from Government so that they expand operations and I am happy that part of the equipment has already been delivered and we will soon hand over state-of-the-art and modern irrigation equipment, he added.Deputy Minister Marapira said Zimbabwe Super Seeds had the potential to raise hybrid seed output to nearly 300 tonnes if adequate support was extended to the firm.Before Government moved in to assist Zimbabwe Super Seeds, the firm was getting material and financial assistance from the Swiss Government through the Swiss Development Corporation.Besides raking in foreign currency for rural farmers, the hybrid seed venture at Fuve-Panganai had also created employment for scores of youths in Zaka, which is one of the biggest districts in Masvingo.
