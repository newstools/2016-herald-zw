LONDON. &#8211; The money on offer in China is mind-boggling. 400 000-a-week is an incredible contract. And then it is so easy to say that Alexis Sanchez is a player at the peak of his powers, he is 28 later this month and there is no way such a stellar name would go to China. But that completely misses the point. It has given Sanchez one hell of a bargaining tool in negotiations with Arsenal. And that s why the Chinese development is so significant.Sanchez s representatives can &#8211; and have done so already &#8211; go into Arsenal and say what they are being offered in China and demand the same.It leaves Arsenal in such a difficult position because there is no way they can possibly match it but Sanchez has got them by the short and curlies.Yes, Arsenal should not have allowed Sanchez to go into the final two years of his current 130 000-a-week deal but the Chile forward really was not that good last season so there was not such a rush. In fact, there was even a few whispers that Sanchez was dispensable last summer. But as soon as the season started, Sanchez switched to the middle, played out of his skin and suddenly it s negotiation time.Arsenal now face a major problem. Less so with Mesut Ozil as the feeling is that the Germany midfielder is happy, will sign and will get a deal of around 200 000-a-week.But things are far less certain with Sanchez. There is major interest from top European clubs, like Juventus, Paris Saint Germain and others are looking.But none of them can match the money on offer in China. And Sanchez knows it. His agent has a fine reputation, is well liked, Sanchez is playing well, but who wouldn t hold out for their market worth? &#8211; The Mirror.
