Joice MujuruNduduzo Tshuma Bulawayo Bureau TENSIONS are brewing in the Dr Joice Mujuru led Zimbabwe People First Party (ZimPF) over the nomination of one of the vice presidents from Matabeleland region ahead of the party s congress early next year. According to party insiders, members are now split in allegiance between Bulawayo provincial coordinator Ms Esnath Bulayani and Dr Samuel Sipepa Nkomo, who recently defected from People s Democratic Party, touted as front runners in the race.The battle has also spilled to the party s WhatsApp chat groups where the youths are trading insults and some of the attacks directed at Ms Bulayani herself. Bulayani is being accused by party youths of trying to use unorthodox means to land the vice presidency when an unwritten agreement seems to suggest that a way should be paved for Sipepa Nkomo to take up the position at the congress, said a source. Because of the insults, Bulayani has left one of the chat groups. Everyone seems to be against her candidature as there is a feeling that she would just spoil things. Sources added that the provincial members have also met informally and endorsed Dr Sipepa Nkomo but Ms Bulayani turned and asked some members to campaign for her. What is now obvious is that Mujuru will have two vice presidents and one has to come from this region. On the ground people are campaigning for Sipepa Nkomo while others are campaigning for Bulayani, said a source.ZimPF spokesperson Mr Methuseli Moyo yesterday said the party was yet to provide a framework for the nomination of members for positions. He said it was normal that towards an elective congress, people will back preferred candidates.Meanwhile, the ZimPF national steering committee met on Tuesday and reportedly suspended its Matabeleland North provincial coordinator Mr Max Mnkandla over allegations of maladministration and failure to work with others. Mr Moyo said he was not aware of the suspension as he was not part of the Harare meeting.
