Zvamaida Murwira Senior Reporter Traditional leaders across the country yesterday received a shot in the arm as they are set to receive 20 kilogrammes of maize seed from a local seed house as part of improving crop yields in the country. The scheme for free maize seed to traditional leaders is set to benefit all 280 chiefs dotted across the country following an appeal by Chiefs Council president Chief Fortune Charumbira to Seed Co to assist the traditional leaders.Seed Co representatives held a meeting yesterday at Parliament building during a chiefs caucus where they discussed modalities on how all the chiefs could access their share. Chief Charumbira said he approached Seed Co a fortnight ago following a plea from fellow traditional leaders who raised concern about inadequate maize seed. Over the past two weeks I received several calls from traditional leaders complaining about seed. I then went to Seed Co where I asked for support. They agreed to support us and today they have come to discuss with us. Each chief is set to get 20 kg of maize seed, said Chief Charumbira while addressing the chiefs council caucus.Seed Co senior agronomist Mr Simbarashe Gotosa, said traditional leaders would get the type of seed commensurate with their geographical areas. He also challenged traditional leaders to organise farming competitions among themselves that would start at district level right up to national level.Seed Co, was prepared to fund Field Days for such events where a winner at national level would be awarded. Mr Gotosa called upon traditional leaders, Senators, to assist in the promulgation of stiffer penalties for fake seed traders. If you travel along Cameron Street, going to Mbare, there are fake seed traders using Seed Co logo. When the culprits are arrested in most cases they are given few hours of community service and sooner than later they would be back in the street selling the counterfeit seed, said Mr Gotosa.
