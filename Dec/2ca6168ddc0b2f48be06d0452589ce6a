MUMBAI. England s humiliating Test cricket series defeat in India painfully exposed an alarming paucity in the side s slow bowling options and drove home the fact they will continue to struggle in South Asia until they unearth some world class spinners. Retired off-spinner Graeme Swann had bemoaned England s indifferent approach towards slow bowling before the five-match series started and his fears were confirmed after the touring side were handed a 4-0 drubbing.The alarm bells would have been ringing when England s spinners were out-bowled in Bangladesh in October, where the side lost their first ever test against the hosts in a series regarded by many as an appetiser for the Indian leg of the trip.That 1-1 drawn series did little to prepare England s batsmen for the main course as India s spin duo of Ravichandran Ashwin, the world s top-ranked test bowler, and Ravindra Jadeja helped themselves to 54 wickets.By comparison, England s main spinners Adil Rashid and Moeen Ali combined for 33 wickets, and the other four slow bowlers used on the tour &#8212; Zafar Ansari, Liam Dawson, Gareth Batty and part-timer Joe Root only claimed seven more between them.
