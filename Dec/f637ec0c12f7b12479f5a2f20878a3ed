Patrick Chitumba Bulawayo Bureau&#8212;GOVERNMENT has approved Gokwe Town Council s $2,8 million annual budget after it was slashed by up to 20 percent from last year s which stood at $3,4 million. Council, according to the town treasurer, Mr Joconia Nyoni, presented a $2 871 256 00 budget to the Ministry of Local Government, Public Works and National Housing, which has since been approved.He said council failed to deliver to expectations with this year s $3 394 634 budget due to the prevailing economic challenges. I am happy to note that the government has approved our 2017 annual budget. We tabled a $2 871 256 00 budget which is down from the current $3 394 634 00. We had to reduce it given the performance of the 2016 budget and generally, the economic situation. Residents and the business sector have been having difficulties in paying bills. We have reduced the budget by between five to 20 percent, varying in terms of items reduced, he said.Mr Nyoni said 26 percent of the budget will go towards capital projects.He said council intends to complete the construction of a new clinic, add a new classroom block at one primary school that is under construction as well as rehabilitate roads among other projects. In terms of capital projects, we intend to do storm water drains to the tune of $24 000, construct a classroom block at the new school and fence it off for about $22 000, gravelling of roads for $45 900, complete the town house for about $59 000, he said.
