LONDON. FIFA president Gianni Infantino has defended the use of the video assistant referee system at the ongoing Club World Cup in Japan after the technology sparked controversy on both instances it was used. Midfielder Luka Modric and manager Zinedine Zidane were critical of the new video technology after Real Madrid s win over Club America on Thursday and Infantino emphasised that the technology was still at the testing stage. We are making the mistakes to take the right decisions, Infantino was quoted as saying by the Kyodo news agency. Mr. Modric will certainly be very happy if next time, thanks to the video assistant referee, he wins a match even if it takes a few seconds to find out whether the match should have been won or not.
