Business Reporter&#8212;A technology company, Cumii International, with presence in about 10 African countries, has rolled out an ambitious programme to equip contractors and technicians with advanced technical skills in line with developments in the technology sector worldwide. As technology is dynamic, Cumii International believes that developing the capacities of local contractors and technicians, known as Technites, is essential to ensure standardised product delivery.A Technite is an installer who provides an installation and/or technical service.Currently, the company has over 500 registered Technites in Zimbabwe who provide a comprehensive installation and are equipped to provide high quality installations, repairs and maintenance. We are well represented across all major towns and cities in Zimbabwe. We currently have Technites registered in Zimbabwe, South Africa, Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, Tanzania, Zambia, Cumii International chief executive officer Norman Moyo said in an interview.Africa, the youngest continent s biggest problem is high rates of unemployment with highly skilled workers who are either unemployed or under-employed which has resulted in stagnated economic growth, crime, drugs, lack of professional development, brain drain, among other ills.There has also been notable challenges with corporates such as FMCG, MNOs which lack innovation, have bureaucratic tendencies, slow decision making, often trumped by smaller more agile entrepreneurial competitors while they run high cost bases.This has brought the need for outsourcing contractors, Technites, to undertake most of the installations and servicing.Technites who receive technological skills from Cumii International are capacitated to manage logistics to deliver high-quality, consistent satellite installations, repairs, maintenance and relocationThey are also equipped to provide installation, maintenance and repair services and create a sustainable financial model for all parties concerned including partners, the mobile network operator (MNO) and contractors.The company has since ventured into training of entrepreneurs in technology. We have begun by training Super Technites (these are the registered business owners who manage the Technites). Feedback from training we did with them has been incredibly positive. Super Technites benefit from getting access to our revolutionary platform which allows them to monitor and manage their teams in the field in real time. They also become more efficient and productive by receiving jobs closest to them based on their availability and broaden their offering through the access Technites provides to multiple technical disciplines, for instance, satellite, fibre, home automation, vehicle tracking, solar, said Mr Moyo.
