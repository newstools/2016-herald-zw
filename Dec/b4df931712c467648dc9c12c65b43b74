Victoria Falls AirportTwo new airlines are expected to start using the new Victoria Falls Airport within the first half of next year, an official said last week. Upgrading of the Victoria Falls Airport was made possible through a $150 million loan that the Exim Bank of China extended and it expanded the runway, taxiways and a new terminal to allow bigger aircraft to land. The upgraded airport increased capacity of the terminal from 500 000 to one million passengers annually.Speaking at the International Civil Aviation Day commemorations, Zimbabwe Council for Tourism president Tich Hwingiri said the new Victoria Falls Airport was already getting interest from airlines. This state-of-the-art facility, which has been dubbed The game changer , has already attracted wide interest from airlines in and outside the region. We now anticipate welcoming at least two new airlines into Victoria Falls within the first half of 2017, he said.Mr Hwingwiri added: We have no doubt that Victoria Falls is destined to become the regional tourism hub as envisaged by the Government. The Civil Aviation Authority of Zimbabwe (CAAZ) also used the opportunity to launch its client service charter, which Hwingwiri said would go a long way in assuring stakeholders of excellent services. The importance of a client service charter cannot be overemphasised as, among other things, it enables customers to get the most out of an organisation s services, he said.Speaking at the same occasion, CAAZ acting general manager John Donga said the authority was seized with upgrading the passenger facilitation systems at the Harare International Airport. We realise that the passenger facilitation systems at Harare International Airport, which is our biggest airport, needs urgent upgrading and is on high priority on our agenda, he said.The International Civil Aviation day was held under the theme, Working together to ensure no country is left behind .
