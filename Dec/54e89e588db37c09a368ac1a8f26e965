LONDON. World player of the year Cristiano Ronaldo rejected a world record 257 million bid from China, his agent Jorge Mendes has claimed. Mendes told Sky Sports Italia on Thursday that the unnamed Chinese Super League side had offered the 31-year-old Portuguese superstar a record 85million a year as salary. From China, they ve offered 300 million euros to Real Madrid and more than 100 million (euros) per year to the player, said Mendes. But money is not everything. Real Madrid is his life. Cristiano is happy at Real Madrid and it is impossible to go to China. China has through its Super League clubs flexed considerable financial muscle in the international transfer market, most recently buying Brazilian international Oscar from Chelsea and Argentinian veteran Carlos Tevez &#8212; with the latter reportedly set to earn 38 mn euros a year.
