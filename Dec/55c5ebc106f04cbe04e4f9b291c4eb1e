Dr Dlamini-ZumaDURBAN. African Union Commission chairperson Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma said yesterday that the freedom of movement of African citizens on the continent would be more advantageous than detrimental. Dr Dlamini-Zuma was speaking at an African Union state of the continent address at the Hilton Hotel in Durban on Monday.She said free movement for Africans on the continent had been pioneered by Rwanda which had seen drastic increases in its tourism and trade sectors. Rwanda was the country that led this move and they opened their borders for all Africans.That kind of policy has seen them increase their tourism by 24 percent and trade by over 50 percent. Generally, the free movement of people has more advantages than disadvantages, she said. If people are free to move they come in and leave. If they know they can t come back at their will, they end up staying. We are developing a comprehensive protocol of free movement and we are hoping it will be signed by 2018, she added.Meanwhile, KwaZulu-Natal Premier Willies Mchunu said he was proud that his province and the eThekwini Municipality were chosen to host this important event . We believe that this is a vote of confidence in our ability to host successfully international events.This event will be broadcast to the whole continent and the global community giving us access to the global audience which is boost for our marketing efforts Mchunu said. The province has positioned itself as the home of African renaissance celebrations as well as an important venue for high profile national and international events that are hosted in South Africa. He also noted that on the 9th July 2002 the Organisation of African Union metamorphosed into the African Union and that the meetings that let to this were held at the Inkosi Albert Luthuli International Convention Centre .
