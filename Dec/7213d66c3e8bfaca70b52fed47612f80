LIVERPOOL. &#8211; Ronald Koeman believes Everton s switch to a more aggressive approach following a lacklustre start to Tuesday night s 2-1 win over Arsenal at Goodison Park was key to ending the north London side s 14-match unbeaten English Premier League run. Everton defender Ashley Williams scored the winner in the 86th minute for the Dutchman s side after right back Seamus Coleman had equalised shortly before halftime to cancel out Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez s deflected opener.And Koeman reacted sarcastically to opposite number Arsene Wenger after Everton ended Arsenal s nine-month unbeaten away run in the English Premier League in an eventful victory at Goodison Park on Tuesday night.Arsenal manager Wenger, defeated for just the second time this season, blamed referee Mark Clattenburg for awarding the first of a series of corners from which Ashley Williams headed in the 86th-minute winner.But Koeman responded bullishly and claimed he had targeted Arsenal s weak points by instructing his players to adopt an aggressive approach against the Premier League title hopefuls. I m not surprised about Wenger s comments because it is the third time in a row that I won as a manager at home against Arsenal, said the Everton manager after Tuesday night s game. - AFP.
