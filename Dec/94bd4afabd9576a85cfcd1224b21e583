LIVERPOOL. &#8211; Jurgen Klopp has dropped his biggest hint yet he is ready to strengthen his Liverpool squad in January but on his free-scoring attack and not his error-prone defence. Liverpool travel to Middlesbrough tonight aiming for a first victory in three games to reignite their English Premier League soccer title hopes in the wake of a 4-3 defeat at Bournemouth and a 2-2 draw at home to West Ham, which has seen them lose ground to their rivals.Klopp has recently played down suggestions he will listen to offers for Liverpool s out of favour England international Daniel Sturridge.The German head coach seems more intent on keeping Sturridge and bolstering his attacking options when the winter transfer window opens next month, though he warned at the difficulties of bringing in players mid-season. The winter transfer market is the most difficult. We are always looking, said Klopp &#8211; AFP.
