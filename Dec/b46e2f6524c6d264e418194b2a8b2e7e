Tawanda Marwizi and Sophia Chese-Msowa &#8212; Sungura ace Alick Macheso s second attempt to go for Ireland tour has failed to materialise amid revelations that the musician and his band members failed to get their visas, again. The trip was initially set for October and had to be moved to first week of December after some band members were denied visas. But the second attempt has failed again.Macheso and his band were supposed to have left the country for Ireland on Wednesday for a performance tomorrow and the show has since been cancelled because other band members could not get visas.In an interview, Macheso s publicist Tich Makahamadze confirmed the development saying they had to plan other shows as a result of failure to fulfil the tour. It is true that we failed to get the visas on time again, the band should have left the country on Wednesday but nothing materialised, he said.He, however, highlighted that they are working with the promoter to see if they can come up with other plans, but it seems they will have to consider the new plan next year. We are working with the promoter and hopefully we will come up with new dates for the show, he said.The musician and his band were supposed to perform in Dublin courtesy of Testimony Entertainment Promotions, but they will have to wait again for some time before making the trip.Macheso was supposed to travel with drummer Givemore Chokumanya, guitarists Tafi Fire Nyamunda and Mike Maikoro as well as vocalists/dancers Jonasi Kasamba, Seleman Majuice Mupochi and Wilson Twitter Meka.The tour would have been be the musician s second visit to Ireland after the 2008 debut tour that came as an extra gig of his UK tour.The development comes after a similar occurrence in July when Macheso travelled with five instead of eight band members for his UK tour when others failed to get visas. During the UK tour Macheso went with Donald Gogo, Devine Wezhira Muzenda, Obert Gomba, Majuice and Twitter.Meanwhile, Macheso has since lined up some gigs for this weekend across the country. He will perform in Dotito on Friday, on Saturday he will be in Bindura and Mrewa on Sunday.
