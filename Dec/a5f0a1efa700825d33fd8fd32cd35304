LONDON. &#8211; Ivory Coast football great Yaya Toure has been banned from driving for 18 months and fined 54 000 for drink driving, he said on Facebook yesterday. The 33-year-old Manchester City midfielder insisted though he imbibed the alcohol by accident. Toure, a four-time African player of the Year and a member of the Ivory Coast side that won the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations, is a Muslim. Over the last two weeks there has been some confusion as to why I was charged with drink driving, as it is well known that I am a Muslim and do not drink, wrote Toure, who was stopped last month while driving in east London and found to be over the limit. I have always refused alcohol. Anyone who knows me or follows football will have seen me refuse champagne for Man of the Match performances because of my commitment to my religion. Toure said the court had also accepted he had not intentionally drunk alcohol but had nevertheless punished him according to the law. &#8211; AFP.
