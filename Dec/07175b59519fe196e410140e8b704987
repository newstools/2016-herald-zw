Before we can forget, this is the year when Donald Trump of The Apprentice Fame was elected the president of United States. Trump not only became a hero on social media but he later popularised some of the memes done by teenagers. Back to reality, who still remembers the selfie, mannequin challenges, the strict laws by ZIMSEC, the tint hair and how motocross rider Tanya Muzinda made headlines during her European tour?Musically, our teen sensation dubbed Zim s Rihanna, Tammy also not only performed at the Miss Tourism Zimbabwe but released a sizzling hot video and album which is appealing.I remember again we were also ambushed in the Apple kingdom as giant mobile guru Apple announced the birth of Iphone 7 and 7 plus which saw many people owning it despite the price.When we are talking of mobile phone Iphone 6s plus and 7, they are the way to go not only considering their functions but their sleekness that makes the Urban Reloaded cool.It was a bad year for Samsung as it announced that the Note 7 will no longer be used especially at airports and planes after a scandal that it burnt while charging.Internationally we can say it has been hard keeping up with the Kardashians in 2016!Needless to say, this famous family is going to have a LOT to talk about this New Year.From relationship drama, to tragedy, the Kardashians and Jenners have had one insane year.First it was Kim s robbery in Paris.Kim Kardashian, was subjected to incredible traumatic experience at the beginning of October, when five intruders broke into her residence in Paris. The five masked men stormed into the building, and held Kim at gunpoint while they robbed her of millions of dollars in jewelry.It s an incident that hasn t left Kim since then. She has since stopped wearing flashy jewelry, and hasn t gone out in public much.There haven t been any paid appearances, and she has been silent on social media.In mid-November, Kanye West, started acting strangely.He was ranting in concert about politics and conspiracy theories, and at one point, cancelled his Saint Pablo tour altogether.On November 21, he was admitted in hospital because of a temporary psychiatric breakdown and stayed under observation for over a week.Mind you, he is the master mind of the ripped and teared up jeans that most of you are donning. Think again about fashion statement, you never know it might have been designed by an almost retarded Kanye.Still on the Kardashians, the big one goes to 19-year-old Kylie who hinted on marriage to Tyga.She was seen flaunting her huge diamond ring on her left finger.Neither Kylie nor Tyga, 26, have ever said that it s an engagement ring, but that doesn t mean they haven t hinted.Kylie posted a pic on Instagram of herself perching on Tyga while wearing a sexy dress, and it was captioned Mr and Mrs Are you trying to kill us, kid?I couldn t help but laugh.As Cool Reloaded our song of the year locally is Mukoko by Tytan and Ammara Brwon while internationally it s Sorry by Justin Bieber.Be guided this survey is by CLS.However, with just few hours left before we turn another page in the calendar, Yours Truly as promised did a quick look back at the year s best movies in partnership with Ster Kinekor theatres.Yes, the movie year is over, and a review of the past twelve months makes clear that movie fans have been spoiled with sterling movies, from blockbuster superhero sagas and low-budget horror thrillers to bizarre dystopian comedies and politically oriented foreign imports. With our late-year binge-watching now complete, our final assessment which still only scratches the surface of everything worth watching proves that, whether at the multiplex or the art house, filmgoers were blessed with a bounty of great offerings in 2016.Alas, what they came up with was hit or miss.On the upside, 2016 saw more diversity in front of and behind the cameras.But studios continued to rely on superheroes, remakes and sequels. Stand-outs could be found here and there ( Deadpool and Captain America: Civil War ), but there were also some epic critical failures ( Suicide Squad and Batman vs Superman: Dawn of Justice )To the rescue, at year s end came a batch of Oscar-ready contenders, many of them screening this month.In fact, some of the best 2016 films includes Deadpool , Doctor Strange , Fantastic Beasts , Ghostbusters , The Jungle Book and Zootropolis (aka Zootopia). Our best pick is Zootopia , oh yes, I can watch the movie 24/7 over and over again.On that note I say Happy New Year and always keep the swag happening. Make sure you start with good resolutions.
