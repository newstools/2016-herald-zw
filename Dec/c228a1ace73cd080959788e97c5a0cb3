He is the one who gave the lessons of music and I have been working hard to achieve a lot. After his death I told myself to keep working hard playing mbira, he said.The UK based musician said it was good to work with other local gospel musicians. Gospel music in Zimbabwe is growing judging by its demand in several countries. My hope is to work with several artists in the country so that we give praise to the Lord, he said.Kamhiriri who has produced several musicians abroad said Kapinga was another artist with great potential to raise the country flag high. We are working tirelessly because we have a goal to achieve. We want to raise the country flag high and I am happy that Kapinga has shown great commitment in helping us achieving the goal, he said.
