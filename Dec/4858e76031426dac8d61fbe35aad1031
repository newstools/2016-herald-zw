Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter TWENTY-year-old Thomas Manyeruke was the toast of the Lysavay Cup Zimbabwe Japan Karate Association (ZJKA) Tournament in Bulawayo on Saturday. Manyeruke, who hails from Kwekwe, used the ushiro geri (back kick) to devastating effect on his way to a gold medal in a fiercely contested senior men s kumite category. The young karateka beat the seasoned David Dube midway through the scheduled three-minute final after the latter got disqualified for excessive contact.Dube settled for silver, while Abychester Chikwanda and Simbarashe Mapwashe were placed joint third in a category that featured 18 fighters, including veterans Emmanuel Mehlo (52) and Henry Kahiya (50).Kelly Ndlovu of Kwekwe won gold in the senior women s kumite category, while Yemurai and Tendai Muchenje, who also hail from the same city, settled for silver and bronze respectively, to cap a fine afternoon for the Kwekwe karatekas. The Muchenje sisters also won gold for Tendai and silver (Yemurai) in the senior women s kata category.Gweru-based karatekas dominated the senior men s kata with Dube winning gold while Allan Chihaka finished second ahead of Kwekwe s Tamuka Ziwira and Gweru compatriot Never Mutizwa who were joint third.Eleven-year-olds Clement Njekeya and Tanyaradzwa Ziwira, for their poise and elegance, stole the hearts of many spectators in the sizeable crowd that witnessed the event at Bulawayo Bowling Club.The tournament was held under JKA rules, which among other things, compelled fighters to engage in bare knuckle duels but with the highest degree of control. Although several karatekas, mainly from Harare and Triangle failed to travel for the tournament due to financial challenges, their absence did not dampen proceedings as those that participated gave it their all.
