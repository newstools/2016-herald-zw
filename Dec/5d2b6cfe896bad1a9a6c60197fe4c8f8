In our article published on December 1 titled No reprieve for Magaya we erroneously stated that Advocate Thabani Mpofu said the complainant confessed to Acting Prosecutor-General Mr Ray Goba that she was not raped, but that she had lied against Magaya. However, it turned out that the correct position is through her lawyer, the complainant confessed to the prosecutor, Chief Law Officer Mr Michael Mugabe from the PG s office.We sincerely apologise for the inconvenience this error caused to the acting PG.
