Sports Reporter&#8212;ZIMBABWE will look to regain the COSAFA Under-20 Championship crown they last won in 2007 when they enter this year s soccer tournament in South Africa as one of the favourites. The Young Warriors have been one of the the most successful teams in the history of the competition with six wins. Their last triumph came in 2007 when they beat then hosts South Africa 3-0 in the final.Since then, the Young Warriors have reached the semi-finals in four of the last five tournaments but only managed a pair of third-place finishes in 2009 and 2010.Though they will be confident of lifting the trophy in South Africa, they face a major hurdle in the opening round when they tackle the most successful side in the history of the tournament, Zambia, who have 10 regional titles.With only one team advancing to the semi-finals, it will be a major battle with Malawi, the third team in the pool. The carrot being dangled in front of the Zimbabwean players are the number of scouts from mostly South African clubs who will be at the tournament to look out for new talent from a country that has a long history of sending quality players to play in the South African Premiership.PSL Rookie of the Year, Prince Dube, of Highlanders, will lead the Young Warriors attack.Zimbabwe Under-20 ProfileBest finish: Winners (1985, 1988, 1990, 2001, 2002, 2007)Last five finishes:2008 Semi-finals2009 Third-place2010 Third-place
