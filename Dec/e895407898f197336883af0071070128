To date, SI 64 has recorded considerable success in the cooking oil industry, yeast industry, biscuit manufacturing, cement manufacturing, dairy sector, battery manufacturing (Chloride Zimbabwe), creams and lotions (Datlabs, MedChem), he said. Plastics manufacturing (Treggers Group), synthetic hair products (Blue Track), detergents sector (Nespot Holdings) and furniture and mattress manufacturing (KDV) among others. Minister Bimha said Government would increase import restrictions to more goods on the market. My ministry is currently under pressure to extend SI 64 of 2016 to more goods as we have facilitated for the retention of purchasing power in our own country, he said. You all agree with me that labour costs, interest rates, exchange rates and economies of scale are the most potent determinants of competitiveness which has reduced the outward approach mentality and rather centralised focus on internal abilities. He said SI 64 was justified to save and revamp Zimbabwe s local industry. In some instances when a foreign country plans to crush our industry by selling goods at a price even below the cost of production, it is a case of dumping, Minister Bimha said. Such a supply of cheap goods might be welcome if it was permanent but it is usually temporary and merely done to kill competition and then make up all losses by charging higher prices.
