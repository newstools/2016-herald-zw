Nyemudzai Kakore Herald Correspondent&#8212;An attempt by members of the National Electoral Reform Agenda (NERA) to hold a demonstration against the introduction of bond notes flopped in Harare yesterday as it was largely ignored by the public. Members of the public turned a deaf ear to the call by NERA to protest against the bond notes that are already in circulation.The notes have been well received by the transacting public.NERA s youth secretary for information, Mr Benson Banga, in a statement, had said the demonstration was a fight to preserve out future , expecting thousands of people to take part.A survey by The Herald indicated that police intercepted a few individuals who wanted to cause chaos along Nelson Mandela Avenue where people were standing in queues outside banks to withdraw cash.It was business as usual at all retail shops, supermarkets, food outlets, banks and the informal sector, while commuter omnibus crews were servicing their normal routes.The bond notes began circulating on Monday after a roll out by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe.The RBZ released bond notes worth $10 million onto the market on Monday with the withdrawal limits set at $50 per day and $150 weekly.The notes are in $2 and $5 denominations and are pegged at 1:1 to the US dollar.A new $1 bond coin has also been released.Despite spirited attempts by opposition groups to discredit the new currency and scepticism by members of the public, many view bond notes as offering relief to the shortage of US dollars.Chief police spokesperson Senior Assistant Commissioner Charity Charamba said she was yet to get details of any protests. I am still trying to get information of what transpired today (yesterday), she said.NERA s legal affairs secretary Mr Douglas Mwonzora said he could not comment on the failure of the demonstration as he was in Cape Town for the screening of the Democrats and referred questions to NERA s organising secretary, Mr Joelson Mugari, who was not reachable for com- ment.In an interview with The Herald, Mr Takaidza Takaidza, who was withdrawing money at a local bank, said instead of joining the protests, he would rather work for the benefit his family and country.He called on members of the public to appreciate Government s efforts in mitigating the cash crisis.Kuwadzana resident Mrs Priscillar Cheat dismissed the anti-bond notes demonstration as a joke saying people had embraced the notes.Police were deployed on the ground to ensure people went about their business undisturbed by rowdy elements.
