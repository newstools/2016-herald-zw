BARCELONA. Luis Suarez celebrated his bumper new five-year Barcelona deal in style with a double as the champions defeated Espanyol 4-1 in the Catalan derby to move to within three points of Spanish La Liga soccer leaders Real Madrid. However, it was Andres Iniesta and Lionel Messi s skills that stole the show as Barca took advantage of Real s duties in winning the Club World Cup earlier on Sunday to cut the gap at the top ahead of La Liga s three-week winter break.Iniesta teed up Suarez for an early opener before both Iniesta and Messi showed sublime touches for the second eventually finished off by Suarez.Messi created Barca s third as well for Jordi Alba before David Lopez pulled a goal back for Espanyol as their 10-game unbeaten run came to an end.The five-time World Player of the Year wasn t to be denied, though, as Messi got the goal his performance deserved a minute from time.
