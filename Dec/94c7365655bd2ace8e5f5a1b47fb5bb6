As the ZNSSA, we are saying we are fully behind ZIFA president Philip Chiyangwa. We feel that it is high time we have a Zimbabwean at the helm of COSAFA and we believe that Chiyangwa will change the fortunes of soccer in the Southern Africa region. He has the skills and experience to transform football in the region, said Nyatanga.Nyatanga, who is expected in South Africa tomorrow, has called upon Zimbabweans in that country to converge in Rustenburg to show solidarity with the ZIFA president, I am also calling upon other Zimbabweans in South Africa to converge in Rustenburg tomorrow for a show of solidarity with the ZIFA president (Philip Chiyangwa), he said.Chiyangwa is already in South Africa to drum up support ahead of the landmark elections.
