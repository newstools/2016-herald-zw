RUSTENBERG. A year after shocking his rivals to win the ZIFA presidency, Philip Chiyangwa goes into another poll today vying for the COSAFA leadership at Sun City. Chiyangwa will battle it out with current COSAFA boss Suketu Patel, who is expected to win, and SAFA president Danny Jordaan.COSAFA chief operations officer Sue Destombes confirmed this week that Jordaan will contest for the presidency. The Council of Southern Africa Football Associations will hold its annual general meeting on Saturday, December 17 at Sun City in South Africa, where the office-bearers for the next five years will be determined, read Destombes statement. Elections will be held to decide the positions of president, vice-president and for the executive committee. Three nominations for the position of president were received prior to the November 2 deadline. These are for incumbent, Suketu Patel, South African Football Association president, Danny Jordaan and Zimbabwe Football Association president, Philip Chiyangwa. Jordaan also ran for the position five years ago, but pulled out at a late stage, saying at the time: I presented proposals to change the structure of COSAFA but it was very clear that out of the 14 countries, my proposals were always split 7-7. So I decided that people were not ready for a new direction and a new vision. I will continue to work in football and perhaps I must spend more time strengthening my relationships (with other African administrators) on an individual basis. Sports Reporter/African News Agency.
