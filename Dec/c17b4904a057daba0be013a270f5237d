Ephesians 4 vs 31; Let all bitterness, wrath, anger, clamour, and evil speaking be put away from you, with all malice. I have never understood how people end up becoming nasty and malicious. Last week, I followed some social media platforms with interest as someone I know was being attacked in a nasty way. It has become the norm that when people fall out, they will go out to damage the other person s image and reputation using this new found medium that can spread information at the speed of lightning.Things get out of control really fast and before you know it untold damage would have occurred. We are all capable of extreme anger and in fact, we have become very intolerant of anything that goes against us.Today, you may be the victim or the proponent of malice. Let us all ask the Lord to grant us the power of restraint, the ability to be tolerant and more importantly patience in the face of adversity.May we display wisdom in our response to the things that anger us. Our Lord and Saviour can and will mould our character to reflect His image which is love. May all our actions be guided by love and our footsteps be directed by the Lord.Be blessed.REFLECTIONS OF A WORK IN PROGRESS . . .For more info: Visit our website: www.thefig-tree.org; e-mail us on info@thefig-tree.org; catch us on StarFM, Monday to Friday at 0620hours.
