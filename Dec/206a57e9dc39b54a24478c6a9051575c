NASSAU. Tiger Woods sees daily progress in his return from a 16-month back injury layoff and hinted on Saturday he is still chasing the record 18 golf majors won by Jack Nicklaus. Woods, a 14-time major champion, sizzled early for the third consecutive round but fizzled late in firing a two-under-par 70 at his comeback event, the Hero World Challenge hosted by his charity foundation. I m just not quite there, but it s coming. The great thing is I m building and each day I ve gotten a little bit stronger, said Woods, who admits tiring on late holes. I m definitely not as fresh as I would like to be. No matter how much you work out it s very different than being in playing shape. There are all these different things you can t simulate at home. Woods, who has not won a major since the 2008 US Open, was asked after his round about trying to catch Nicklaus even though no player has won four majors after turning 41, which Woods will do later this month.
