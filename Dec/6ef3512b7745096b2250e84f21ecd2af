Grace Chingoma Sports Reporter&#8212;THE feud that has soured ZIFA and Premier Soccer League relations took another turn yesterday with the association taking a tougher stance and ordering interim chairman Kenny Mubaiwa to implement a raft of measures they believe should whip the top-flight body into line. ZIFA last week appointed Mubaiwa as their chosen candidate to lead the PSL following the ban they imposed on Peter Dube.Mubaiwa had initially been appointed to lead an emergency committee of the league that had been set up by the clubs in the wake of Dube s suspension for allegedly contravening sections of the ZIFA constitution.The Dynamos president had, however, been coy about his appointment, arguing that he was still to receive official communication from ZIFA outlining the mandate he had been given by the association.ZIFA president Philip Chiyangwa has since written to Mubaiwa officially communicating the steps which the soccer mother body wants him to implement, which they believe would also help reform the PSL.Chiyangwa also hinted on a looming suspension of PSL chief executive Kenny Ndebele whom the ZIFA boss accused of fermenting the frosty relations between the league and the association.The ZIFA boss gave Mubaiwa until tomorrow to get a report from Ndebele after which he would meet with the pair, with the PSL chief executive expected to defend himself.The trio s meeting, scheduled for tomorrow, is however, likely to be shelved to next week as Chiyangwa is in South Africa to attend the COSAFA elective congress, where he is also challenging for the regional body s presidency.But the Harare property mogul made no secret of his intentions to crack the whip on the PSL through the tasks that he gave Mubaiwa to follow.ZIFA last week also directed the PSL to promote four teams while demoting two, a move that effectively means the top-flight body would need to amend its constitution and accommodate an 18-team league.The PSL, which is currently made up of 16 teams, is yet to respond to the ZIFA directive.But they have a case pending with the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Switzerland, which the top clubs believe could be the only impartial arbitrator in their dispute with ZIFA.Chiyangwa said ZIFA s appointment of Mubaiwa to be interim chairman of the PSL was covered for by Articles 34 (e) and 34 (o) of the association s constitution. I write to advise you that the ZIFA executive has with immediate effect appointed you as the interim chairman of the ad-hoc committee to be overall responsible for the affairs of the Zimbabwe Premier Soccer League in terms of Article 34 (e) and Article 34 (o) of the constitution, Chiyangwa said.Chiyangwa also directed Mubaiwa to start the PSL constitutional reform process, working in conjunction with the ZIFA Constitutional Review Committee led by lawyer Itai Ndudzo.The interim PSL chairman is also expected to ensure compliance with the ZIFA constitution by all member clubs. Together with the ZIFA Constitutional Review Committee, you are required to prepare for a constitution making process for the clubs of the Premier Soccer League that must be approved by the Executive Committee and ultimately by Congress and which must in all respect conform with the requirements of the ZIFA Constitution, wrote Chiyangwa.The ZIFA president further tasked Mubaiwa to probe the conduct of Ndebele. You are required to interview and compile a report on the conduct of one Kenny Ndebele, particularly the manner he has fostered and sponsored the breakdown of relationships between ZIFA and PSL members in violation of the ZIFA constitution. You are therefore required to produce a report of his responses, in his presence before the ZIFA president at 2pm on the 16th December, wrote Chiyangwa.ZIFA also made it clear to the Dynamos president that they expect him to see through the audit process, which has been initiated by the association. You are required to fully facilitate and co-operate the forensic audit commissioned by ZIFA over the affairs of the PSL from 2009 to date, wrote Chiyangwa.Chiyangwa also indicated that he wants the PSL to engage ZIFA first before concluding any sponsorship deals for the league. You are mandated to pursue and negotiate local sponsorship deals for the Premier League teams of which you must submit to ZIFA before signing to avoid situations where the PSL is short-changed in any sponsorship deal. You are also mandated to explore the possibility of external sponsorships and partnerships but you must seek the approval of ZIFA before the conclusion of any such negotiations. In particular, you are required to avoid situations where illicit commissions and third parties benefit at the expense of the football structures as was the case when the SuperSport deal was signed, wrote Chiyangwa.Mubaiwa is also expected to continuously liaise with Chiyangwa as well as ZIFA chief executive Joseph Mamutse in the execution of his duties.
