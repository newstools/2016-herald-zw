TOKYO. Tokyo 2020 organisers unveiled yesterday a budget of $16.8 billion for hosting the next Summer Olympic Games and vowed to seek further savings in co-operation with the International Olympic Committee (IOC) which has been calling for them to cut costs. At an a open meeting of a four-party working group that includes the IOC, organisers said they estimated overall costs of 1.6 to 1.8 trillion yen ($15-$16.8 billion), the first official figures they have released since winning hosting rights. At a previous meeting about three weeks ago, organisers had said costs could run to as much as 2 trillion yen, a level that IOC Vice President John Coates had deemed too high. We are pleased with the progress we are continuing to make, Coates said via video conference yesterday.He noted the $4.7 billion portion for the organising committee s budget would all be paid for through sponsorship, IOC contributions and other private funds, at zero cost to the public, meaning they were really looking at a budget of $12.1 billion. The four-party political working group will continue to operate and play an important role going forward in the budget process, Coates said. Reuters.
