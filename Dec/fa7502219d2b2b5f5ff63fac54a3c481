MANCHESTER. Manchester United boss Jose Mourinho has left players and staff up in arms after he cancelled Christmas. The Special One has ordered players and staff to prepare for a 4:30pm training session at Old Trafford on the festive day. Staff who are normally able to stay at home with a morning training ground run-out are now having to leave their families to work at the stadium.The team usually train at Carrington on Christmas morning like other clubs before spending the rest of the day with their loved-ones. And in previous years former boss Louis van Gaal has even given everyone, including players, the day off to be at home with their families. Clubs typically train on Christmas Day morning ahead of a full Boxing Day fixture list. But Mourinho whose side play at home against Sunderland on Boxing Day has ditched the tradition as he seeks to turn his side s fortunes around. The Sun.
