Tedious Manyepo Sports Reporter CAPS United pacy winger Phineas Bhamusi is on cloud nine after he finally managed to lay his hands on the coveted Premiership title, three years after he came short in cruel circumstances at Harare City. Bhamusi, who was arguably Makepekepe s unsung hero throughout the just-ended season, was in that doomed Harare City side, which looked well on course to win the title but fell short in the final day of the 2013 season after they were pegged to a 2-2 draw by CAPS United on a wet afternoon at the National Sports Stadium.All they needed was just an outright win to be crowned champions.That draw allowed Dynamos to sneak to the podium after they saw off Black Mambas 2-0 at Rufaro on the same afternoon.Bhamusi is now a relieved man after he, along with his steel-nerved teammates, managed to contain the pressure to win the crown. It is a good feeling to win the league title, the season was characterised by some ups and downs as more than four teams were clearly in running for the championship. Every team which we played against gave us a good run for our money but somehow we managed to work out the formula to outwit themaid Bhamusi.&nbsp;
