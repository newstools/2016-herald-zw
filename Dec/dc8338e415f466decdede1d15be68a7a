Thupeyo Muleya Beitbridge Bureau&#8212;Beitbridge Town Council will next month start installing more street and tower lights in high density suburbs and crime hotspots, an official has said. Speaking during the local authority s end of year party last week, council chairperson Mrs Showa Moyo, said the project was in line with the town s development master plan.She said the council managed to install 17 solar powered street lights in the town this year in partnership with the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply and Distribution Company.It is understood that the new street lights last for over five years, with 50 000 hours of lighting.Mrs Moyo said they were planning to extend the project to traffic and tower lights, which are dotted across the town. We are looking at installing at least two solar powered tower lights and more street lights in business centres in the northern part of the town, she said. This is a cost cutting measure on our part as the local authority since we will rely more on renewable energy and we have a lot of sunlight in this town even during winter and hence the need to be innovative. Mrs Moyo said the town was developing rapidly and there was need to create a safe environment for the residents and visitors by ensuring that there was adequate lighting.She said the incidents of pedestrians and motorists being robbed or mugged during the night were rampant, especially in areas where there was no adequate lighting.Mrs Moyo appealed to residents to pay up their bills so that the local authority would remain viable.Beitbridge Town Council s revenue collection stands at 42 percent and is owed around $9 million by residents and government departments.Mrs Moyo said besides the installation of solar lights, the local authority was working on upgrading storm water drains to avoid flooding, which has become perennial. We have lined up a number of projects for next year, including construction of a new bus terminus, a laboratory at Vhembe High School, procuring earth moving equipment, construction of a town council workshop and setting up of modern flea market stalls, she said.Mrs Moyo said they will upgrade Dulibadzimu Stadium, set up a satellite clinic in the Garikayi area and tar roads.
