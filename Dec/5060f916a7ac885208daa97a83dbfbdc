Progress ChipfumoArts Correspondent &#8212; The current cash crisis has been cited as one of the factors affecting live show attendance and Junction 24 along Harare-Chitungwiza highway has come to the rescue of merrymakers by lining up free shows this weekend. Beginning tonight until Sunday, the venue will host artistes and entry to the shows will be free. Tonight Progress Chipfumo and his Sounds of the Motherland band perform at the joint while Jean Masters, backed by Masters Band, comes for a family show on Sunday.Tomorrow it will be a day of mixed bag of music with DJ Tenny on the turntables. Junction 24 director Tavepi Madzigira said the free shows were meant to thank their loyal patrons that have been coming to the venue throughout the year.Junction 24 will pay the artistes for their performances while patrons enjoy the shows for free. It is the time of the year when we say thank you to our patrons. December is a time of giving and these free shows are our gifts to merrymakers. We understand challenges people are facing due to the cash crisis and we are saying they can just come and enjoy music here without paying, said Madzingira.The venue has hosted big names that include Oliver Mtukudzi, Alick Macheso, Suluman Chimbetu, Jah Prayzah and Winky D with patrons coming to support the shows in a big way. We would have loved to host one of the big artistes for free, but the costs are prohibitive. We decided to bring good entertainers that charge affordable performance fees in order to celebrate with our patrons. Jean Masters and Progress Chipfumo are good at live shows while DJ Tenny has been outstanding with his selections. We just thought the team can make a good weekend of free shows. We know it will be an exciting weekend. The artistes all expressed gratitude for the gesture and said the arrangement would provide a perfect platform for their fans from all walks of life to come together.
