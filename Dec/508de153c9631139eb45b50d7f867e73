Elita Chikwati Senior Agriculture Reporter THE Cotton Company of Zimbabwe (Cottco) has secured $1,1 million to pay price adjustments to cotton farmers, starting next week.The company bought last year s cotton at an interim 35 cents per kilogramme, with a price adjustment of 10 cents per kilogramme expected to be given to farmers when resources became available. Cottco managing director Mr Pious Manamike last Wednesday confirmed the payment of the 10 cents adjustment to cotton farmers.He said the price adjustment was meant to motivate farmers. We are at an advanced stage to pay farmers. We have secured about $1,1 million. Farmers were happy with the price and that is why we have witnessed renewed interest this season, he said.Zimbabwe is expecting 150 000 tonnes of cotton in the forthcoming season following Government s intervention with free inputs under the Presidential Inputs Scheme. Last year, 30 000 tonnes of cotton were produced after the crop was affected by drought.Cotton farmers were last year funded by the Government under the Presidential Inputs Scheme and the assistance will continue for the next three seasons as the State seeks to revive the textile industry.Farmers received a full package of inputs for a quarter hectare from Government that included seed, fertilisers and chemicals.Government has warned merchants against buying the crop under the Presidential Inputs Scheme while farmers who are side-marketing will face stiff penalties.Cottco is the sole buyer of the Government-supported crop.Government has records of the people funded under the programme and farmers are not allowed to side-market.
