Feed a thousand membersTawanda Matanhire Cool Lifestyle Reporter&#8212;Prince Edward High school Human Rights Association launched the Feed a Thousand initiative at Jairos Jiri Centre last Saturday. The event saw disadvantaged people s homes from around Harare benefiting from a supply of food stuffs. The association mobilised other schools to participate in the initiative which will be done annually to cater for less privileged people around the country.Other schools which took part were Westridge, Dominican Convent and Tafara 2 High.President for Prince Edward Human Rights Association, Amon Nqubani Sibanda who is the brains behind the initiative said the aim was to instil a sense of social responsibility to teens in schools around the country so that they give generously regardless of their backgrounds. Teens need to be able to be responsible especially taking care of the less privileged in the society. If they come together they can gather resources which can help others regardless of their backgrounds, Sibanda said. As teenagers we saw it fit to give so that we inspire other children to do even more, he said.Beneficiaries included Tariro orphanage Trust, New Start Centre, Bs Leon, Street Ahead, Wailing Women, Ndaiziva Capacity Development Trust, St Johns Emerald Hill, Runyararo Children s Home, Buhera Disabled Against Poverty, and 42 child headed families in Mabvuku. Feed A Thousand Initiative is an annual event which was inspired by the economic blue print s provision to ensure food security considering the drought from the last rain season and the economic hardships being faced in the country.Sibanda said the initiative was not limited to school students but everyone who can assist because their goal serves a purpose for the whole nation. The initiative received donations from organisations including Gavton Investiments, Applegate Technologies, Power Advertisements, Savemore Westlea, Koala Butcheries, Zimbabwe Football Legends Association and Tanganda among others.
