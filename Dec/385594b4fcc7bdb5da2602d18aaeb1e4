Tonderai NdirayaPaul Mundandi Sports Reporter NGEZI Platinum Stars, Zimbabwe s representatives in next year s CAF Confederation Cup, have secured the services of some of the Premiership s most-sought-after soccer players as they seek to bolster their squad ahead of their maiden dance in the Africa Safari. The Mhondoro-based side will know who their opponents are today when CAF conducts the draw in Cairo, Egypt.And Ngezi Platinum are leaving no stone unturned as they aim to make a loud statement in the continental competition next year by going into the transfer market to buy new players. Yesterday, they added Tsholotsho s Maclive Phiri, Dominic Mukandi from Dynamos and former Bulawayo City skipper Xolisani Moyo to their squad.The platinum miners are also chasing the signature of Mutare City s Agrippa Murimba, who was expected at the mine yesterday. The Chibuku Cup winners have already signed Qadr Amin, who had snubbed them at the beginning of the season, opting to join How Mine on a one-year contract.Amin and Ngezi Platinum Stars mentor Tonderayi Ndiraya s relationship dates back to their days at Dynamos, when the former played under the latter in 2014, though Ndiraya was an assistant coach. I can confirm that we have signed Maclive ((Phiri), Xolisani (Moyo) and Dominic (Mukandi) and we are currently busy registering all our players. We are closing on the new signings this afternoon (yesterday). We will be sending the names to the board for approval but as Ngezi Platinum, we are now ready to go and play in Africa. We are very happy and we are not going there to add numbers but to compete, said Jeremiah Gasiteni, the platinum miners chairman. A number of players on Monday converged in Ngezi to try their luck and among them was Dynamos rightback and Soccer Star of the Year finalist Godknows Murwira, as well as Edgar Mhungu, who captains Northern Region Division One runners-up Herentials.Ngezi Platinum are expected to play their CAF Confederation Cup preliminary round tie on the weekend of February 10 12, with the second leg pencilled for the weekend of February 17-19 next year.Both legs of the preliminary round ties of the tournament start in February, while the first round proper takes place in March.
