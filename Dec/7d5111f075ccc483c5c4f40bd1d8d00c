Bright Chiororo (40) and his sister Sinikiwe Mparutsa (46) are facing four counts of fraud.Mr Mambanje varied the pair s reporting conditions and ordered them to report once a month at their nearest police station instead of once a week before postponing the matter to December 14.The pair s lawyer had submitted that his clients needed time with their children.The complainant is Classic Super Foods, represented by its director Alvin Mparutsa, who is also Sinikiwe s husband. Sometime in September, October, November and December 2011, Sinikiwe misrepresented to Classic Super Foods Private Limited that Chiororo was employed by the company and was awarded different amounts as salary.
