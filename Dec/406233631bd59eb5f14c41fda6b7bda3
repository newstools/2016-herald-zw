WASHINGTON. A majority of American voters favour delaying the Electoral College vote scheduled for today until electors can be fully briefed on alleged Russian interference in the election, according to a new poll conducted by YouGov. The survey, sponsored by the progressive advocacy group Avaaz, found 52 percent of people supportive of stalling the vote.A surprisingly high number of people 46 percent were also willing to support so-called faithless electors, the name given to members of the Electoral College who spurn the vote of their home state and vote for a different candidate instead.President-elect Donald Trump s opponents have been pressuring electors to break with their state s voters, and a law firm has even offered pro bono, confidential legal advice to any elector curious about his or her options. Avaaz has collected thousands of signatures on a petition calling for the vote to be delayed.Trump won a fairly wide Electoral College victory on Election Day, but Hillary Clinton is on pace to beat him in the popular vote by some 3 million.In a sign of how divided the country is, however, more than 1 in 4 Republicans believe that Trump in fact bested Clinton in the popular vote.That belief may stem from a false claim Trump himself made on Twitter, when he said that he would have won the popular vote had millions of people not voted illegally.
