SYDNEY. West Indies all-rounder Andre Russell was given the all-clear to use his black bat in Australia s Twenty20 Big Bash League yesterday after it was initially banned for leaving marks on the ball. Russell was banned from using the distinctive bat after it discoloured the white ball during the derby between his Sydney Thunder and the Sydney Sixers last week.Cricket Australia reversed the ruling yesterday after assurances that the bat had been modified with the addition of a clear laminate cover to prevent the problem recurring. We re now satisfied that the bat will not compromise the integrity of the game by discolouring the match ball and we have granted approval for Andre to use the bat in any future BBL matches, said league chief Anthony Everard. The decision fits with the Big Bash League s embrace of novelty to attract and entertain crowds but it appears the arrival of the touted December 25 match might have to wait until the 2018-19 season.
