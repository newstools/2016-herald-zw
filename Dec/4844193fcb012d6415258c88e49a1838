Talent Gore Herald Reporter A new healthcare facility to afford civil servants and pensioners access to medical treatment on flexible payment terms has been launched.Rapiso Health Assist came at a time when most people were crying foul over rejection of their medical aid schemes by service providers for various reasons. In a statement recently, Rapiso clinical service manager Mr Michael Chitsa, said the facility was vital in situations where one urgently needed health service, but did not have cash. For one to be a member, he or she pays a nominal joining fee of $12 per annum. Once you are on the Rapiso database, accessible online to health care providers, you can walk into any of the healthcare providers in the event of emergency illness. Members can access services and sign stop order facility forms for the Salary Services Bureau, he said.Mr Chitsa said members would access services and drugs on credit at minimal charges.With a Rapiso card, one can access general practitioners, specialists, pharmacies, private and Government hospitals across the country.Government is also working towards setting up a national health insurance scheme to cater for the welfare of the most vulnerable members of society.The scheme will cushion those who are unable to pay medical bills.At least 90 percent of Zimbabweans were not on medical aid and such intervention will go a long way in catering for those who cannot afford medical bills.Most medical aid societies are struggling to pay for the beneficiaries services, a development that has resulted in several medical aid cards being rejected at most health institutions.Civil servants were among the most affected members of the medical aid societies with most of them contemplating to leave their traditional societies.
