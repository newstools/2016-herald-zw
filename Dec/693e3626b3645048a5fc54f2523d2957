From George Maponga in Masvingo&#8212;Most lodges, boarding houses and educational institutions in and around Masvingo are getting a facelift after receiving funding from the ruling Zanu-PF for them to offer suitable accommodation to over 5 000 delegates expected to attend the revolutionary party s 16th national annual people s conference later this month. Zanu-PF has so far secured over 7 500 beds that will be used by delegates to the indaba that will run from December 13 to 17.The conference will be held under the theme, Moving with Zim-Asset in Peace and Unity at the Masvingo Showgrounds.All hotels and lodges in and around Masvingo have been fully booked for the week-long indaba with the ruling party leadership in the province also sourcing extra accommodation from schools, colleges and univer- sities.Speaking during a recent visit to Masvingo to assess the province s capacity to accommodate the delegates, Zanu- PF Secretary for Transport in the Politburo Cde Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri expressed reservations about the state of some of the lodges booked for delegates.Cde Muchinguri-Kashiri said the lodges needed a facelift adding that the ruling party would release funds for the refurbishment exercise.Acting Zanu-PF Masvingo provincial chairman Cde Amasa Nhenjana yesterday confirmed the ruling party had released the funds, but declined to give figures. The party (Zanu-PF) recently released funding that is being used to spruce up some of the lodges and educational institutions where our delegates will be accommodated during the forthcoming conference. I cannot reveal the exact figure that was released but the money will go towards procurement of things such as bed linen, installation of new windows and doors together with making sure that the lodges where our people will be staying have running water and operational toilets, he added.Besides hotels, lodges and education institutions, Masvingo residents have also offered their houses to accommodate the delegates.The ruling party in Masvingo has raised over 55 beasts and nearly $60 000 in cash from donations to feed and accommodate del- egates.Pitching of tents and construction of access roads at the conference venue is almost complete, while three boreholes have been drilled to augment water supplies from Masvingo City Council.Mucheke Clinic is also undergoing rehabilitation to help it cope with emergencies that might arise during the indaba.
