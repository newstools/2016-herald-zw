Direct Contact Private School carved its own piece of history in the narrative of the school when it opened its doors to the public in Mandara on November 19. The occasion was marked by pomp and fanfare as dignitaries, pupils and parents in attendance revelled at the commission of the new classroom blocks that would be operational beginning 2017.Built on a four hectare-piece of land, the new school that was constructed at a cost of $600 000 boasts of state of the art computer laboratory, well-equipped staffroom and preen ablution facilities.The commission of the new school will also see Direct Contact being transformed from a private college to a private school, in a move that is expected to increase student enrolment from its current figures.Director of Direct Contact Mr Wellington Koke said the commission of the new classroom blocks was a harbinger of an exciting journey that lies ahead. We have come a long way and the commission of the new classroom blocks fulfils our long cherished dream of owning our own premises. It is also an affirmation of our commitment to provide quality education to the discerning parent and student, he said.It has indeed been a long way for Direct Contact, which was started under Msasa tree along Kaguvi Street more than 10 years ago.From mere passion to making a difference in Zimbabwe s education system, Direct Contact has grown from leaps and bounds, to become one of the reputable private schools that continue to churn out top results for both Zimsec and Cambridge public examinations.Direct Contact, which started off as a mere institution targeting students who wanted to repeat either O or A Levels, has transformed overnight to become one of the few reputable private colleges with a high pass rate for public examinations.For three years, Direct Contact has been receiving the best student award in Environmental Management as a subject at Advanced Level for Cambridge in the whole world.This year one of its students received the accolade among other high flying students from different colleges and conventional schools across Zimbabwe.What is undoubtedly clear is Direct Contact s unwavering commitment to produce the best students who are able to respond to and match economic dictates across the globe. Several former students of the institution are now studying in various universities and tertiary institutions across the globe.All that achievement and more can be attributed to Mr Koke s vision and commitment in ensuring that Direct Contact becomes a centre of academic excellence.Mr Koke s contribution and expertise has been the hallmark of success at Direct Contact as attested by the pass rate the college has been getting in the Cambridge public examinations for both Ordinary and Advanced level since the inception of the college.
