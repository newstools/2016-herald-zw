Get ready for Chipawo s Christmas party todayTawanda Matanhire Cool Lifestyle Reporter&#8212;Chipawo will present the play Mary Christmas that will be a special offering to their Zimbabwean fans at the Harare Gardens Theatre in the Park tonight. Mary Christmas is a story about Mary the mother of Jesus Christ.Chipawo Spokesperson Chipo Basopo said in the story, Mary is portrayed as a woman of dignity, admiration, and hallowed. Mary is a woman of dignity, admiration and hallowed even in the bible, but everyone of today s generation always want to be a Saint Mary in their own understanding, she said.She said children were visualising the story of Mary in today s set up and taking all the clamours of the girl child arising from all parts of the country. The children take you through an imagination of who Mary is in the 21st century, looking at how much the girl child is going through and how then society will be able to appreciate children during this Christmas time, Basopo said.Children will share their experience with other children from Zambia, Elysium Magna and other kids from various CHIPAWO centres.Over the years Chipawo s Annual Christmas shows have been funded by various organisations but this year s edition was made possible by the support of the parents, friends and the National Foods Limited.Every year since 1995 the Chipawo community has presented a Christmas show with a difference either on stage or for television.Organisers hinted that the Christmas show of Chipawo was notonly meant to provide entertainment and enjoyable Christmas experience for its family audience, but it was also meant to present Christmas material with a difference, relevant to the local people.Basopo said this was an important responsibility for Chipawo to ensure that Zimbabwean Children were not only accustomed to foreign models and idioms but also relate to international and national events like Christmas in their own languages and in their own context.
