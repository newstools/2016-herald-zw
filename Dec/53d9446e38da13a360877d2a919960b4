Paul Mundandi Sports Reporter DYNAMOS legend George Shaya says they are not effecting a boardroom coup at the turbulent giants but they were only following the club s constitution. A faction led by Ernest Kamba, which Shaya supports, ousted the club s leadership led by Bernard Marriot at an indaba held in the capital on Saturday.Another Dynamos legend, Moses Chunga, attended the meeting.It appears the club s legend have ganged up against Marriot who now looks isolated. We have elected a new interim board of directors and all we want now is to see the Dynamos of the sixties, seventies and the eighties that swept almost everything, said Kamba. We have been there and we know how it is done. Our aim is to bring back sanity at the biggest institution and smiles to the millions of Dynamos fans who rally behind the biggest team in Zimbabwe. We know what is expected from us because we are the ones that made Dynamos. We are also looking forward to the coming of Bernard Marriot. He is one of us and will remain one of us. We want him to come and join us. Kamba was elected the interim board chairman and will be deputised by Simon Sachiti. Gina Kapfunde will run the secretariat portfolio of the board with the board member for finance still to be elected.Shaya, Willard Sarupinda, Joseph Tsuro, Peter Huni and David Phiri were elected committee members. Let me set the record straight. Please do not write in your papers that it s a coup but we are making right what was wrong and we are bringing the legal aspect, said Shaya.Meanwhile, DeMbare beat Highlanders in a penalty shoot-out at Barbourfields yesterday in a match held to celebrate the Bulawayo giants 90th anniversary.The game ended 2-2 in regulation time but Dynamos prevailed in the shoot-out lottery in a very competitive game.The Glamour Boys appeared heading for a loss but equalised just two minutes before the end of regulation time through a Godknows Murwira penalty.
