LONDON. &#8211; Deposed Formula One world champion Lewis Hamilton reportedly made the startling threat to quit a quarter-way through the season, unhappy with the way Mercedes dealt with the fall-out from his race-wrecking collision with Nico Rosberg at May s Spanish GP. The news emerged on race day in Abu Dhabi and concerned what may have been as much of a turning point in this year s championship as his engine blow-up in Malaysia.While rumours of Hamilton s reputed threat have swirled for months, Sunday marked the first time that he was specifically questioned about the claims. And when asked by Sky F1 if they were true, Hamilton pointedly refused to deny the story. After the crash in Spain there was a story you said I m going to stop, I m going to give up . Is there any truth to that? asked Sky F1 s Martin Brundle. That is all private stuff that is in the past, replied Hamilton.So not a denial then. So what really happened and what does it tell us about Hamilton s mind-set this season as Mercedes contemplate how to deal with the latest controversy to envelop their star driver?Did Hamilton really threaten to sit out the rest of 2016? Sky Sports understands Hamilton told the team he didn t want to drive again in 2016 after the Spanish GP on May 15.Hamilton and Rosberg had crashed out on the first lap of the race and Hamilton is thought to have been angered by the team s refusal to accept privately if not publicly that Rosberg had been at fault for their collision. &#8211; Sky Sports.
