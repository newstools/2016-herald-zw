Reason Razao Herald Reporter Harare East Community Share Ownership Trust (CSOT) is set to construct a multi-purpose home industry complex for small to medium enterprises in Mabvuku. The move is meant to economically empower residents in home-based industries. The home industry complex would comprise workshops and stalls. It will benefit people from Mabvuku, Tafara and Highlands. CSOT administrator Mr Tawanda Mandizha told The Herald last week construction of the home industry would go a long way in formalising the small and medium enterprises. The project is set to benefit the greater community of the Harare East district. This is our first project. The project will not only help in formalising the SMEs sector but will also provide ground for entrepreneurs, he said.Mr Mandizha said the complex would consist of 28 workshops, 192 factory stalls and a common facility centre. The home industry is expected to accommodate people who engage in technical work such as welding and carpentry, among others. Councillor for ward 20 Harare East, Joseph Rose said the home industry project was welcome. The industry will benefit residents of Mabvuku-Tafara and also the surrounding areas because it is going to provide facilities to people operating from their homes. We are aware that the project might not cater for everyone but it is a starting point for us to do more, he said. Harare Chamber of SMEs chairperson Mr Taurai Marembo described the project as a good initiative.
