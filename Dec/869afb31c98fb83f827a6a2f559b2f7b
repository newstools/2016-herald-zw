LONDON. Manchester United want Jose Mourinho to remain at Old Trafford until 2025. Mourinho is just six months into the four-year-deal he signed in the summer worth a staggering 15m-a-season. But despite struggling to make a huge impact since replacing Louis van Gaal, club bosses have been so impressed with him that handing him another long-term contract is already on their minds.Senior figures inside Old Trafford have confirmed they would be happy for Mourinho to still be manager in nine years time.Mourinho (53) has never spent more than three seasons at any of the previous clubs he has managed.Despite becoming one of the most successful bosses of all time, the Portuguese has been at seven different clubs since taking his first job at Benfica in 2000.But if he goes on to make Manchester United great again and his bosses get their wish, Mourinho will still be there when he is well into his 60s.Mourinho has made a turbulent start to life at United, losing three of his first seven games at the helm and being hit with two FA charges that have resulted in touchline bans.But in recent weeks United have gone on a 10-match unbeaten run that has seen them reach the semi-finals of the EFL Cup, Europa League knockout stages and close the gap on the top four in the Premier League.United still trail league leaders Chelsea by 13 points, but his superiors believe Mourinho can still catch his old club and win the title this season.Starsport understands United chiefs are convinced United are close to becoming one of the best teams in Europe again under Mourinho.Rival directors have told them that United look a far better side than last season and have made good progress under Mourinho.Mourinho s erratic behaviour on the touchline and in press conferences has been a concern to United bosses, as exclusively revealed in Starsport.Mourinho has served two touchline bans and also fined 50 000 for comments made about referee Anthony Taylor ahead of United s game at Liverpool.United admit they would prefer him to be in the technical area instead of the stands.But United also accept the ranting and raving comes with him being one of the world s box office managers.United s owners the Glazer families, along with executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward, knew what to expect when they lured him to Old Trafford and are used to volatile behaviour &#8211; having dealt with former boss Sir Alex Ferguson doing the same during his glittering time at the helm.Meanwhile, Manchester United have completed a 37.8 million deal for Victor Lindelof, according to the Benfica defender s former team-mate.Robin Blomme, who played alongside Lindelof at Swedish side Vasteras SK, claims that United have secured an agreement with Benfica s president, Luis Filipe Vieira, for a deal in the January window.Blomme also claimed that Lindelof will play his final game for Benfica on Wednesday evening as the Portuguese champions take on Rio Ave.On Tuesday, reports in Portugal claimed that a deal had been agreed between United and Benfica for the 22-year-old.Lindelof was signed by Benfica from Vasteras SK five years ago and has helped the Portuguese club win two league titles.This season, he has emerged as the club s first-choice central defender, although he is also capable of covering at right-back.Lindelof played alongside Zlatan Ibrahimovic for Sweden at Euro 2016 and the United striker praised the defender for his performances last month. Victor is doing great things, Ibrahimovic said four weeks ago. He has a lot of responsibility for the national team, he is ready for the big clubs out there, it s up to him and what he wants. I know he s hot on the market. The Daily Star.
