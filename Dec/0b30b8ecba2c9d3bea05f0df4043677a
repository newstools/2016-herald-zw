Bellerin and Walcott crowd out De Bruyne as Arsenal worked hard at the back in pursuit of a first clean sheet since OctoberEngland. Second-half goals from Leroy Sane and Raheem Sterling stunned Arsenal at the Etihad Stadium on Sunday as Manchester City came from behind to win 2-1 and move seven points behind leaders Chelsea. Although the visitors looked to have got over Monday s 2-1 defeat at Everton by scoring on four minutes when Theo Walcott rounded off a thrilling three-man move, they ended up losing the lead, and all three points, for the second time in five days.City, who had looked hesitant before the break, transformed into an irresistible attacking force after the interval and equalised on 47 minutes when Sane rounded off David Silva s precision pass with his first goal since his 46-million-pound ($57.49-million) move from Schalke.Sterling scored the winner after 71 minutes, picking up Kevin de Bruyne s raking crossfield pass to cut inside on to his left foot and beat Petr Cech at the near post. The result dropped Arsenal to fourth place.While, Tottenham Hotspur came from behind to beat Burnley 2-1 in the Premier League on Sunday, with Danny Rose scoring the winner with just under 20 minutes left.Ashley Barnes put the visitors ahead in the 21st minute but the lead lasted only six minutes, Dele Alli equalising from a cross by Kyle Walker.Another England international, full back Rose, hit a fierce winning goal from a pass by Moussa Sissoko, who could have been sent off earlier for a challenge on Stephen Ward.Tottenham stay fifth, 10 points behind leaders Chelsea, while Burnley remain three points above the relegation places.More-so, Southampton forward Jay Rodriguez bagged a brace to inspire his side s 3-1 win against local rivals Bournemouth on Sunday.Rodriguez hadn t scored in the Premier League since August but he ended that barren stretch with a second half double in the south coast derby at Dean Court.Claude Puel s team had fallen behind to Nathan Ake s early opener, but Ryan Bertrand levelled soon after to set the stage for one of the better days in recent memory for the injury plagued Rodriguez.Southampton s second win in their last nine away league matches lifted them into seventh place, while Bournemouth remain in mid-table.Just 33 miles separate these south coast rivals, but derbies between them have been few and far between.The rariety of the fixture seemed to give extra intensity to both teams in a scintillating opening.Eddie Howe s side made the perfect start when on-loan Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere lofted a perfectly-weighted cross to the far corner, where Ake escaped his marker to plant a diving header past Southampton goalkeeper Fraser Forster.Joshua King had a chance to increase Bournemouth s lead with a powerful shot that Forster kicked away.But Bournemouth were in front for only eight minutes as Saints left-back Bertrand equalised with a superb individual effort.
