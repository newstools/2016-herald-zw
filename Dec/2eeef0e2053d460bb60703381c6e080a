Fungai Lupande Herald Reporter Harare suburbs that include Westlea, Dzivaresekwa and Glen Lorne will be without water until tomorrow following a main pipe burst at Warren Control in Warren Park yesterday morning. Harare City Council spokesperson Mr Michael Chideme said they were working to rectify the situation.He said the city lost a lot of water in the mishap which affected nearby houses but did not cause damage. Last night we switched on pipes at Morton Jaffray Water Works to resume water supplies after maintenances, he said. After the servicing at Morton Jaffray water treatment plant, naturally we get an improved service. There was more water coming through and the pressure caused the burst. It affected water supplies to Letombo, which supplies water to Eastern suburbs like Mabvuku-Tafara. We have resumed pumping water to Letombo through another line but the burst is affecting the Workington area and Northern suburbs in Harare, said Mr Chideme. We are working flat out to get the necessary pipes to replace the ones that burst. It s unfortunate that after maintenance at Morton Jaffray we encountered a problem because of the improved capacity. He said supplies to affected areas were expected tomorrow.Turning to the refurbishment at Morton Jaffray water treatment plant, Mr Chideme said they were 90 percent complete. We have done a lot and we are almost through with refurbishment of the plant but from time to time we service it like what was happening over the weekend, he said.
