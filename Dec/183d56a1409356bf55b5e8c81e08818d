CANBERRA A century from David Warner and fifties from Steve Smith, Travis Head and Mitchell Marsh helped Australia post an imposing 378 for 5 to set up a big victory of 116 runs over New Zealand in their second one-day cricket series in Canberra yesterday. New Zealand could only manage 262 all out in response slumping to a second defeat in the series and giving Australia an unbeatable 2-0 series lead with one to play.Apart from an early edge that flew wide of second slip Warner looked in fantastic touch in sharp contrast to Aaron Finch who continued to struggle and could only manage 19 before Mitchell Santner bowled him round the legs.Warner and Smith would set Australia up for a big finish with a huge partnership with both batsman making the most of the small ground to keep the scoreboard ticking over.Kane Williamson produced a great catch to remove Warner for 119 off just 115 balls including 14 fours and a six.Smith would depart shortly after Warner having raced to 72 off 76 balls and Australia were 248 for 3 with just over ten overs to go.Travis Head played another gem of an innings making 57 off 32 balls striking six fours and two sixes the second of which immediately preceded his dismissal.Head chipped a wide half volley from Southee straight to backward point which brought a great innings to a disappointing end.With Mitchell Marsh under pressure to perform he turned on the power hitting when head departed smashing an incredible seven sixes in his unbeaten 76 as he helped his team maximise the death overs.New Zealand needed Martin Guptill to fire for them to succeed and he looked in fine touch to start with.Tom Latham made just four runs in a 40 run opening stand before he bunted one back to Josh Hazlewood.Guptill fell shortly afterwards having been deceived by Pat Cummins use of the scrambled seam leaving New Zealand 52 for 2 and without their biggest hitter.Williamson and Jimmy Neesham, who continued to bat at four, put on a partnership that threatened to get the Kiwis close.Neesham (74) and the skipper put on 125 but with the Black Caps falling behind the rate required the left-hander had to try to launch and couldn t get under one from Hazlewood.With the Black Caps chasing the game they lost Colin de Grandhomme (11) and Willimson (81) and the tail was exposed.The chase fizzled out as Starc and Cummins ran through the tail and the contest was over long before the match ended.Cummins was the pick of the Australian bowlers picking up figures of 4/41 from ten overs.
