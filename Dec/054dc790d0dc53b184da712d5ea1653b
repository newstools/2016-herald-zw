Ellina Mhlanga Sports Reporter ACTING Sports Commission director-general Joseph Muchechetere says there is need to put in place a sport and recreation strategy if the country is to realise its full potential. Muchechetere was in Angola for the African Union Sports Council Region Five Under-20 Youth Games and Zimbabwe came second behind South Africa. Commenting on the team s performance in Angola, Muchechetere said with the sport and recreation policy in place, a national strategy on sport is vital in complementing the former to ensure that the country s fortunes in such competitions continue to improve. The fact that we finished second to South Africa is a wake-up call for us so that we see the gaps in our system. Once we identify those gaps, we should be in a position to mobilise our stakeholders so that we close those gaps. The Ministry of Sport and Recreation came up with the sport and recreation policy and worked flat out to ensure it was approved by the Government, they have done a good job and that is a starting point. The second is to come up with a sport and recreation strategy. What needs to be done is to move a gear up and operationalise the policy. The policy is there to just give us a guide and the roles, what the Government wants and what the people of Zimbabwe want but not the practical side, said Muchechetere.The national policy, adopted by the Government in August, is designed to promote inclusive participation of previously marginalised communities and remodel sport into a multi-million-dollar industry. It also seeks to address gender disparity in sport and development of talent, among other things. Muchechetere said the national strategy, if put in place, will address a number of issues, including setting up proper supporting systems for the identified talent.
