Zifa-houseSports Reporter&#8212;FOOTBALL authorities at ZIFA and the Premier Soccer League have been summoned to parliament this week to explain the state of the game in Zimbabwe. The leadership, who are currently at loggerheads over relegation and promotion procedure, are expected to appear before the Portfolio Committee on Education, Sport, Arts and Culture chaired by Matobo North Member of Parliament Never Kanye this Thursday.According to a circular from Parliament, the football leaders will present oral evidence on the challenges and achievements in Zimbabwean football.PSL chief executive Kenny Ndebele acknowledged the invitation from parliament. I can confirm we have received the invitation from parliament and I am in the process of circulating to the governors. Probably. by end of day tomorrow, I should be able to stand guided on what we are going to do as PSL, said Ndebele.The Premier Soccer League have just completed a successful season which ended with CAPS United winning the championship.ZIFA are also expected to report on the success and challenges in a hectic year in which both men and women s senior football teams were involved on the international stage.However, the report on the achievements by the Warriors and the Mighty Warriors is likely to be dwarfed by the negative developments that have painted football in bad light of late.ZIFA and PSL were recently plunged in crisis in the wake of a decision by the association s Congress to relegate four teams and promote four from the regions.This was against their resolution at last year s meeting when they agreed to demote two and then engage in play-offs involving four winners from the Division One leagues for the two Premiership slots available.But when the PSL indicated they could not afford to bankroll the promotion play-offs, the ZIFA Congress decided to revert to the old system to relegate four teams. The decision was not welcomed by the PSL who felt it was not in line with the tenets of fair play as it was communicated with just two matches remaining in the league programme.This has led to confusion as Chapungu and Tsholotsho, who finished third and fourth from the bottom, are still not sure of their status next season.However, ZIFA and the PSL representatives agreed on Saturday that only two teams will be relegated from the top-flight league this year.What is left is to decide what will happen to the four Divison One regional league winners with the possibility of all of them being admitted into an expanded PSL or a play-off being held.
