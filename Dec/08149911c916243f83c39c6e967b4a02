Paul Mundandi Sports Reporter &#8212; WARRIORS second choice goalkeeper Donovan Iker Benard has been undisputed number one for his club and he is slowly rising to be arguably one of the finest goalkeepers to be produced in this country. The agile goalkeeper is slowly following the footsteps of his late father Mirirai Benard who was a marvel to watch as he jealously guarded the posts at the now-defunct Premier League side Black Aces where he fought for the number one jersey with Emmanuel Shumba Nyahuma.Donovan s late father could have been the key figure in mentoring the How Mine goalkeeper, but his rise to the top can be credited to Richard Tswatswa who knows better than anybody the strengths and weaknesses of the rather shy young goalminder.With the Warriors coach, Callisto Pasuwa embarking on a massive rebuilding project of the Warriors the nation can take comfort in one of the upcoming barricades in the last line of defence.When Donovan was called to the national team a number of fans questioned his inclusion. He was to spend most of his time warming the bench in the Warriors.Donovan an Aces Youth Academy product began his top-flight career at Motor Action and thanks to Joey Antipas who put faith in young players, who included midfielder Wisdom Mutasa and striker Walter Musona following an exodus of a number of senior players from the now defunct Mighty Bulls.The upcoming goalkeeper always wants to do better and is always hardworking which has seen him excel.His distribution is a key weapon for his team whose coach, Kelvin Kaindu always believes in starting play from the back.Donovan received plaudits from his national team coach Pasuwa and his teammates after turning a fine show between the posts in Zimbabwe s 0-0 draw against Cote d Ivoire in Abidjan on Boxing Day.The Warriors using largely locally-based players as part of their preparations for the Nations Cup for which Donovan is one of four goalkeepers currently in camp.One of the four who include Tatenda Mukuruva, Takabva Mawaya and Nelson Chadya who will be dropped when Pasuwa names his final 23.With Pasuwa deciding against tampering much with his goalkeeping department, Donovan is assured of a place in the Gabon-bound squad, barring any last minute calamities.Yet the Highfield-born goalkeeper remains level headed and is keeping his feet to the ground despite his heroics in Abidjan which included saving a penalty six minutes from time. It is something very normal for me to save penalties. I am, however, very happy that the coaches gave me the nod to guard the posts against a very talented side who were playing at home I am at the national team to play my part as a team member and I am very grateful that the coach believed in me, he still believes in me and I will keep on working hard so that I do not disappoint him. He has a lot of confidence in Tatenda (Mukuruva) and myself. I am hoping that Zimbabwe for the first time will go past the knock-out stages and bring smiles to our fans. God willing we have to go for gold, said DonovanThe 21-year-old player s contract with How Mine expires today and he is still to decide on his future.
