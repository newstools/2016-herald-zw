Cde ChomboFrom George Maponga in Masvingo zanu-pf has plans to build permanent structures in all the country s 10 provinces that it will use to convene crucial meetings such as annual national people s conferences, secretary for administration Dr Ignatious Chombo, has said. Dr Chombo said the issue of zanu-pf having its own facilities would ease the burden of preparing for the annual conferences.Every year the ruling party forks out millions of dollars hiring and setting up facilities to hold either the annual national people s conference or congress.zanu-pf holds conferences four years in a row followed by a congress in Harare in the fifth year.This year s conference will be held at the Masvingo Showgrounds beginning tomorrow up to Saturday.The meeting is being held under the theme, Moving with Zim-Asset in Peace and Unity. Speaking during a tour of the venue on Saturday by Vice Presidents Phelekezela Mphoko and Emmerson Mnangagwa to assess the state of preparedness to host the conference, Dr Chombo said building of permanent facilities in every province would remain top on the party s priorities.This was after VP Mnangagwa had asked national political commissar Cde Saviour Kasukuwere, to explain what had happened to earlier plans to build permanent zanu-pf structures in every province to host key indabas.VP Mnangagwa said his home province, the Midlands, was the only one that had so far managed to build such a structure.Dr Chombo assured VP Mnangagwa that the issue of permanent ruling party facilities remained top on the party s agenda. We will make sure that each zanu-pf province in the country has its own permanent structures and the issue will remain on the agenda until every province has its own facility, he said. At the moment some private companies like Roonies are benefiting because we hire them to help us with facilities when we want to have important gatherings like the one opening here next week (tomorrow) but our target is to have our own permanent facilities in every province that will also house party offices, he added.In her brief, zanu-pf secretary for Transport and Welfare Cde Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri, said preparations for the conference were almost complete, adding that nearly 100 buses had been hired to transport delegates.Cde Muchinguri-Kashiri said accommodation for all delegates including Politburo members, Cabinet ministers, Central Committee members and other senior party officials was ready.She said that it was work in progress at the Great Zimbabwe University hostels to house some of the delegates.She said schools and colleges were now ready to take in the delegates.
