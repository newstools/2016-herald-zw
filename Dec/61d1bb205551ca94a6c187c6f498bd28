Eddy Zviitwa aka Eddie KebabMargaret Matibiri Herald Reporter HARARE businessman Eddy Zviitwa popularly known as Eddie Kebab has taken his abusive ex-wife to court, branding her a thug and lunatic denying him peace. Zviitwa accused Kundai Mazvivana of physical and psychological abuse. He pleaded with the civil court to grant him a protection order against Mazvivana. The matter has been set for hearing on January 26 next year.In an affidavit filed at the civil court, Kebab accused Mazvivana of stalking and embarrassing him in front of people. My ex-wife has been violent towards me for no appropriate reason. On November 19, she stalked me until I stopped at a roadblock, where she physically handled me, tore my clothes and broke my car keys. At the same time she hurled obscenities at me and threatened unspecified action towards me, he said. Kebab claimed Mazvivana was a threat to his life. Due to my ex-wife s conduct, I no longer feel safe as she might descend on me any time to humiliate me as she has done before. She attacks me with impunity and without regard to the physical and emotional trauma that she causes me. She has no regard for the law and takes it upon herself to abuse me. Her vapid and vicious thuggery conduct and lunacy has caused me to approach this court for protection. She exhibits the character of a furious and scorned woman. Zviitwa said Mazvivana should pursue legal means if she has any problems with him instead of taking the law into her own hands. For instance, if she has issues relating to our son s upkeep, surely she has other platforms that she can pursue to find redress than making herself a lawful authority thereby, physically and verbally assaulting me, he said.
