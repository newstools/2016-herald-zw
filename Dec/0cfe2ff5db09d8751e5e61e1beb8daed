Blessing Malinganiza Herald Reporter Employees of mission, independent and Government-run schools have petitioned the Ministry of Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare over the conduct of the National Employment Council for Zimbabwe Schools Development Association which they accuse of siding with employers in labour disputes. In a letter addressed to the Registrar of Labour dated November 28, 2016 written by the Zimbabwe Educational Union for Council Mission, Independent and Government- Run Institutions (ZECMIG) Mr Peter Sika, the association said the NEC was operating without the employee component. We are a bona fide union, registered by yourselves and we have followed all the rules and regulations of our industry. The NEC-ZSDA/C hands are dirty, they are operating with only the employer component. The purported employee component is a nullity at fact and at law. The NEC executive is very much aware that the purported employee component is labouring under a valid interdict. The ZMCMIG said it was shocked by the NEC s disregard to this anomaly.It argued that NEC was operating without employee component while the whole essence of unionism is to safeguard the interest of the workers.The petition was signed by hundreds of members ZMCMIG.&nbsp;
