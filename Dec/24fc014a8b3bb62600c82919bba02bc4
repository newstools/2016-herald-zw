DOUALA. Seven Cameroon players have said they do not want to go to the African Cup of Nations soccer finals, setting them on a collision course with the country s football federation and a possible ban from playing for their clubs while the tournament is on. Joel Matip of Liverpool is one of the seven who told coach Hugo Broos they are not interested in being selected for the tournament in Gabon, which starts on January 14. These players have put personal interest above those of the national team and the federation reserves the right to take action against the players in accordance with FIFA regulations, said Broos in a statement on Tuesday.The other six are Andre Onana (Ajax Amsterdam), Guy Roland Ndy Assembe (Nancy), Allan Nyom (West Bromwich Albion), Maxime Poundje (Girondins Bordeaux), Andre-Frank Zambo Anguissa (Olympique Marseille) and Ibrahim Amadou (Lille).All seven had earlier this month been named in a preliminary list of 35 for the tournament, where Cameroon are drawn in Group A with the hosts, Burkina Faso and Guinea Bissau.
