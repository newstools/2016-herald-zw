Dr SekeramayiNyemudzai Kakore Herald Correspondent&#8212;Defence Minister Dr Sydney Sekeramayi has commended the Zimbabwe Defence Forces for remaining resolute in discharging their constitutional mandate of safeguarding the country s sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity amidst the challenges induced by the illegal western sanctions regime. Addressing delegates at the graduation ceremony for Junior Staff Course Number 33 at Manyame Air Base on Friday, Dr Sekeramayi said the ZDF had not been spared the illegal sanctions and as such, the graduation was another illustration of the ZDF s resilience in the face of trying times. As you are aware, Zimbabwe was placed under illegal economic sanctions by Britain and her allies that were aimed at effecting regime change by removing the country s constitutionally elected Government through crippling its key institutions, stifling economic growth and fomenting civil disobedience, he said. The ultimate objective of the illegal sanctions was to reverse the country s land reform programme which the Government had embarked on for the purpose of correcting skewed historical land ownership in the country that favoured minority white farmers. The Course commenced on July 4 2016 with a total of 28 students; 20 males and eight females.Of these, 18 were drawn from various directorates in the Air Force of Zimbabwe while the remaining 10 were drawn from the Sadc region.Dr Sekeramayi said training and development is instrumental for the sound functioning of organisations and flourishing of careers and as such, it is the ZDF s top priority to regularly train its officers for them to competently and confidently discharge their duties.He said a career in the defence forces calls for critical decision making, coordination, planning, controlling and organising. It is, therefore, pleasing that the Zimbabwe Defence Forces runs vibrant training and development programmes to adequately prepare its officers to undertake such tasks. My Ministry, notwithstanding competing demands and the current financial constraints, is committed to continuing supporting training and development in the Zimbabwe Defence Forces by availing the required resources. Dr Sekeramayi said he was delighted that the School of Academic and Staff Training continues to immensely contribute to the ZDF staff training exchange programme with various countries in the region and beyond.He said the programme seeks to strengthen bilateral and multilateral defence and security cooperation in Africa especially the Sadc region. The instrumental role of joint military training in enhancing military cooperation in the region can never be over emphasised and the ZDF will keep the doors of its training institutions open for more allied students. Dr Sekeramayi said the students who graduated undertook a joint low intensity operation with the Joint Command and Staff Course Number 29 of the Zimbabwe Staff College in Gutu, at the site of the Kamungoma battle that was fought during the liberation struggle.He said this was important as it gave students better understanding of guerilla warfare tactics and modus operandi.The participants also wrote the Commandant s Research Paper each on pertinent defence and security topics and all this was aimed at moulding the graduands into competent and confident officers.The Junior Staff Course Number 33 sought to instil confidence and competence into the students building on the skills and knowledge acquired from cadet course and subsequent military course.Secretary for Defence, Mr Martin Rushwaya, Commander Zimbabwe Defence Forces, General Dr Constantino Chiwenga and other senior army officials attended the event.
