Shakes MashabaJOHANNESBURG. Bafana Bafana coach Ephraim Shakes Mashaba was fired yesterday for insulting top South African football officials last month, the national association said. Mashaba was fired as national coach for gross misconduct and violation of the Safa communications policy .The hearing took place over five days in December (5-7, 9 and 12) and was chaired by an independent legal expert who is an Advocate of the High Court. Mashaba was hauled over the coals to answer charges related to his conduct in Polokwane on November 12 after the match between Bafana Bafana and Senegal.The sacking was expected after heated exchanges between the 66-year-old and South African Football Association (SAFA) president Danny Jordaan following a World Cup qualifier.Mashaba refused to accept the touchline congratulations of the official when South Africa defeated Senegal 2-1 to become co-leaders of a qualifying group for the 2018 finals in Russia.Soon after, the coach became embroiled in a verbal slanging match with Jordaan and Dennis Mumble, chief executive of the national association.Mashaba had been angered by public criticism from Jordaan and Mumble the previous month over the failure of South Africa to qualify for the 2017 African Cup of Nations in Gabon.Charges of gross misconduct, gross insubordination and violation of SAFA communication policy were laid against Mashaba.The former defender with Soweto-based domestic giants Orlando Pirates was found guilty of all charges. Due to the seriousness of the coach s actions, we had to release our head coach with immediate effect, said Mumble in a statement. We shall immediately institute a search for a new head coach familiar with African football competitions. (He) will be expected to continue the quest to qualify for the world s apex football competition (World Cup). It is regrettable that we had to face the events of the past month at a time when the national team is experiencing a resurgence in its quest to qualify for the 2018 World Cup.

Because we will be in Equatorial Guinea for almost a month as we are going to win the Cup of Nations, and I need a lot of clothes, was his cocky reply.South Africa were eliminated after the first round having lost to Algeria and Ghana and drawn with Senegal despite scoring first in all three games.His rollercoaster ride continued with failure to make the 2017 Cup of Nations finals, finishing an embarrassing third behind Mauritania in a mini-league won by Cameroon.Bafana fared better in World Cup eliminators, beating Angola home and away in a knockout tie and, after drawing in Burkina Faso, overcoming group favourites Senegal in Polokwane.South Africa, who won the Cup of Nations in 1996, were ranked 12th in Africa and 60th in the world by FIFA yesterday.Confirmed Bafana Bafana 2017 fixturesAFCON 2019 qualifier (March 24-26) opponents TBCInternational friendly on March 28 opponents TBCCape Verde v South Africa August 28South Africa v Cape Verde September 2South Africa v Burkina Faso October 2Senegal v South Africa November 6
