Government has introduced an electronic application system for Form One boarding places for 2017. This is part of a raft of measures to fight corruption that for a long time has seen many intelligent children from poor backgrounds being sidelined by some schools. The ministerial online application system has been dubbed electronic Ministry Application Platform (eMAP) and is expected to become operational soon.According to Primary and Secondary Education Minister Lazarus Dokora the enrolment process would be undertaken over a day. There are 329 549 pupils in the Grade Seven class of 2016 and all these candidates should obtain a clearance letter from their last Grade Seven schools. Local secondary schools are well-positioned to absorb all learners in their catchment area (zone). However, there are only 24 000 boarding places. No parent or guardian should have unrealistic expectations for the placement of their dependent child into boarding school. It is for this reason that all prospective boarding learners with a clearance letter from their last school will use the eMAP application system. Minister Dokora said the application date for parents seeking boarding places for their children would be December 16, 2016.Parents are required to complete an electronic form specifying three schools of their choice.The form would then be forwarded to the relevant schools and parents would get feedback via an SMS on the outcome of their application by December 19.Enrolment for both boarding and day-school places was set for December 20.The electronic application system is expected to bring efficiency and transparency to the admission process.
