LONDON. &#8211; Prompt start, even more prompt finish &#8211; this was a grilling that Arsene Wenger clearly wanted to be over and done with. By 8:58am yesterday he was sat in his chair taking the first question of his usual nine o clock briefing. More significantly, when he decided he had enough he closed proceeding with an abrupt thank you , usually the duty of the club s head of media Mark Gonnella, permanently sat in the shadows behind him.With the Alexis Sanchez contract situation rumbling on, the first mention of China and the wall came up.Was there an update on his future? No. Does the lack of Financial Fair Play give Chinese teams an advantage? I don t know, he added tersely. If people want to go to China, they go to China. You can understand that I have completely different worries than China today ahead of the Manchester City game. Would a player use an offer from China as a negotiation tool? Look, I think I closed that subject, Wenger snapped. I believe that there is nothing more to add to that. &#8211; The Daily Express.
