LOS ANGELES. &#8211; Golf officials have altered the controversial rule that cost Dustin Johnson a one stroke penalty during his US Open triumph this year. As a result of the incident that significantly overshadowed the final day at Oakmont, the United States Golf Association (USGA) was heavily criticised. Johnson was penalised after being judged to have been responsible for moving his ball a fraction of an inch on the fifth green during the final round. He had been initially absolved by the referee with his match.But officials then examined video evidence and informed the eventual champion, seven holes later, that he may be subject to a penalty. As a result the climax of the year s second major was farcically completed without anyone knowing the leader s score.Johnson finished four strokes clear of the field but after meeting USGA staff was told he must alter his score on the par-four fifth from a four to a five, cutting the margin of victory to three shots.Now the USGA, in conjunction with fellow rule-makers The Royal and Ancient, have acted to prevent similar controversies in the future.From January 1, 2017, tournament officials at all levels can invoke a Local Rule which eliminates the penalty when a ball is accidentally moved on a putting green. We took the view that the rule was not working as well as it looks on paper and that we needed to try and address this, David Rickman, executive director of governance at the R&amp;A, told BBC Sport. &#8211; BBC Sport.
