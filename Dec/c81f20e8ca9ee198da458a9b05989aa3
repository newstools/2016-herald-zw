CHARLES MUNGOSHI JNRLeroy Dzenga &#8212; Controversial hip hop artiste Stunner, nearly got into a fistfight with renowned author, Charles Mungoshi Jr at the Zimbabwe Hip hop Awards held at a club in the capital last Thursday. The confrontation started when Stunner`s manager Brandon Vokal Bakasa ordered Mungoshi to keep a distance from Stunner`s new wife Olinda, a request which the visibly drunk Mungoshi refused to honour.Upon hearing the exchange of words between his manager and Mungoshi, Stunner started pushing Mungoshi alleging that, The curse of being young and successful author had touched his wife indecently.An infuriated Stunner went on to hurl obscenities at Mungoshi, threatening to beat him up for not respecting his spouse. The heated verbal confrontation had to be stopped by part of Stunner`s entourage who created a barrier between the two who seemed eager to exchange blows. Why did you touch my wife? You do not know how much I paid for her bride price. You have no right to be touching my wife.I bet you do not even have half of the money I paid for her and you want to touch my wife, Stunner shouted as members of his struggled to restrain him. Bystanders in the VIP section had to intervene to keep Mungoshi and Stunner away from each other since the two looked eager to trade blows.With tempers flaring, Stunner`s wife calmed the situation by asking her husband to overlook the misunderstanding, dragging outside the venue. When The Herald caught up with Stunner outside the event venue, he maintained his stance that Mungoshi had touched his wife in an unfavourable manner. The guy, I don t know who he is but he touched my wife and that is being disrespectful. People who disrespect other people`s wives need to be dealt with, the buoyant Stunner said.After the drama Mungoshi disappeared into the crowd and continuous efforts to contact him did not bear any fruit.
