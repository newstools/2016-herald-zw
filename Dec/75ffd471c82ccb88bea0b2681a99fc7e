LIVERPOOL. Jurgen Klopp has branded reports Liverpool are readying a January bid for Arsenal s Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain as nonsense . Liverpool were yesterday linked with a shock 25 million move for the England international when the transfer window reopens next month.The 23-year-old has struggled for consistent starts under Arsene Wenger this term and that had reportedly attracted Klopp s eye to a potential deal. But the Reds boss has rubbished the speculation and insists he is not interested in Oxlade-Chamberlain.The Liverpool boss speaking ahead of his side s visit to Manchester City on New Year s Eve has quashed speculation linking him with a bid for the England winger. Usually I don t say anything about transfer rumours, but I can make an exception, he said. This is nonsense. It s really not interesting what I think about this. From my side, nothing else to say about it. When pressed on the matter, Klopp added: I thought I said everything about the January transfer window. My English isn t good enough to use different words. So I say again, if we think a player can help us in January, February, March, April and May then yes we will do something. I m not sure it will be important for us this year. Liverpool have been impressive so far this season and are currently the Premier League s leading goalscorers. They are six points behind leaders Chelsea and face a huge game against fellow title contenders Manchester City on New Year s Eve.They go into that clash at Anfield having won their last three in a row including Tuesday s 4-1 triumph over Stoke.
