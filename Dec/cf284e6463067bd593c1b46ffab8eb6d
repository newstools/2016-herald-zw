NEW DELHI. &#8211; Virat Kohli s grand dream is to raise one of cricket s all-time best teams who would succeed irrespective of conditions and across formats, the 28-year-old said yesterday. Under Kohli, India have been unbeaten in the last 17 Tests, clocking up series wins in Sri Lanka and West Indies, and thumping South Africa, New Zealand and England at home.Their unassailable 3-0 lead in the ongoing five-Test series against England is another indication of their formidable home form but Kohli would not call his team invincible . We don t feel invincible, the batsman, whose stellar form has been key to India s rise to the top test rankings, said on the eve of the fifth and final Test against England. We respect all opposition. We admit every time we are put under pressure by opposition. We appreciate that, we accept that and try to find a way out of it. We understand we got a lot of cricket to play everywhere in the world. It s not about just one period that we are going through, he said. It s an ongoing process which needs to be sustained for the next five to seven-eight years for us to become a top quality side, to leave a mark on world cricket, to be known as one of the best teams to have assembled on the field. And we want to do it across formats. Kohli knows the hard work it takes to reach the pinnacle of the game and is enthused by the response from his young team. - Reuters.
