Donald TrumpWASHINGTON. There were many protesters but few faithless electors as Donald Trump won the Electoral College vote on Monday ensuring he will become America s 45th president. An effort by anti-Trump forces to persuade Republican electors to abandon the president-elect came to practically nothing and the process unfolded largely according to its traditions. Trump s polarising victory on November 8 and the fact Democrat Hillary Clinton had won the national popular vote had stirred an intense lobbying effort, but to no avail. We did it! Trump tweeted on Monday evening. Thank you to all of my great supporters, we just officially won the election (despite all of the distorted and inaccurate media). He later issued a statement saying:, With this historic step we can look forward to the bright future ahead. I will work hard to unite our country and be the President of all Americans. Even one of Trump s fiercest Republican rivals, Ohio Governor John Kasich, said it was time to get behind the president-elect. We want unity, we want love, Kasich said as Ohio s electors voted to back Trump at a statehouse ceremony. Kasich refused to endorse or even vote for Trump in the election.With all states voting, Trump finished with 304 votes and Clinton had 227. It takes 270 Electoral College votes to win the presidency. Texas put Trump over the top, despite two Republican electors casting protest votes. AP.
