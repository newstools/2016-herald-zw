LIVERPOOL. Jordan Henderson believes Liverpool have discovered a steely resilience which will assist them in their quest to overhaul English Premier League soccer leaders Chelsea. Liverpool claimed a 1-0 win against Everton in Monday s Merseyside derby at Goodison Park thanks to Sadio Mane s 94th-minute goal &#8211; their first victory in the league by that scoreline in 2016.It was also their second clean sheet in succession following a 3-0 win at Middlesbrough and saw Jurgen Klopp s side cut the gap on Premier League leaders Chelsea to six points. It was a big plus for us. We are very pleased with keeping a clean sheet and also in the last game as well, Henderson said. We have looked solid in the last couple of games, which is pleasing. As long as you win that is the main thing. Sky Sports
