A Tafara woman, who burnt the hands of her two minor children using a hot plate stove as punishment for breaking a neighbour s window panes, was yesterday sent to jail for an effective 18 months. The magistrate Mrs Vongai Muchuchuti-Guwuriro, sentenced the woman (name withheld) to 24 months in prison before setting aside six months on condition of good behaviour. The court awards the plea of guilt since you did not waste this court s time and resources. However, you committed a major offence on your own blood as the two complainants are your own children. You showed that you are a heartless woman with no concern for your children s well being and what you did will forever haunt your children. The court will give you a sentence that will help you correct your criminal mind and hopes that you will be a better parent, said the magistrate in passing the judgment.It is the State s case that sometime in October, the two boys who are aged nine and 13, broke a neighbour s window and their mother ordered them to switch on their stove.The two boys were ordered to put their hands on the hot plate until their mother told them to stop and they sustained serious burns.The matter came to light when the mother took her two children to the hospital for medical attention, leading to her arrest.
