LONDON. Zlatan Ibrahimovic has claimed Brazilian soccer legend Ronaldo deserves to be remembered as the best footballer of all time, saying his talent was more natural than that of his namesake Cristiano Ronaldo.Ronaldo, now 40, won numerous titles with Inter Milan, Barcelona and Real Madrid while also inspiring Brazil to a World Cup triumph in 2002, eventually finishing an esteemed international career with 62 goals in 98 caps. In comparison, Cristiano Ronaldo has become Real Madrid s all-time top goalscorer and won three Champions League titles as well as the European Championship with Portugal. Manchester United striker Ibrahimovic, himself one of the best strikers of his generation, was asked to compare the two prolific goalscorers in a recent interview and, as usual, was not afraid to speak his mind.
