CHRISTCHURCH. Opener Tom Latham s career best 137 set New Zealand up for a crushing 77-run victory over Bangladesh in their opening one-day international cricket match at Hagley Oval yesterday. With Latham in commanding form and Colin Munro chiming in with a rollicking 87, New Zealand posted 341-7 and the Bangladesh innings closed at 264-9 with Mushfiqur Rahim retired hurt.It was New Zealand s highest score in 26 matches against Bangladesh and Latham s 158-run stand with Munro was a New Zealand record for the fifth wicket against the tourists.For New Zealand, it was the commanding performance they were looking for after their recent 3-0 hiding by Australia.But for Bangladesh there were few highlights to launch their New Zealand tour.Their talisman Shakib Al Hasan topped their bowling (3-69) and batting (59) performances, and Mosaddek Hossain was not out 50 at the end, his maiden ODI half century.
