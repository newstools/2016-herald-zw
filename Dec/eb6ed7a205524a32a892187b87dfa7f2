 . . . applies for parliamentary vehicleZvamaida Murwira Senior Reporter&#8212;NORTON National Assembly Member Mr Temba Mliswa, who vowed not to accept a parliamentary vehicle last year saying it was a waste of taxpayers money, has now applied to have one. Mr Mliswa, an independent candidate, is on record strongly criticising the parliamentary vehicle scheme.Before his expulsion from Parliament last year when he was Zanu-PF Hurungwe West MP, Mr Mliswa did not take delivery of his Ford Ranger bought for him by Parliament.He argued Government should buy cheaper vehicles locally to save money.But in a major climbdown after his recent election as Norton MP, Mr Mliswa submitted his name for the vehicle and is set to drive one by year end.Some of the 35 recently-elected legislators have since taken delivery of their vehicles.Mr Mliswa was among several MPs expelled from Zanu-PF and eventually from Parliament last year for alleged links with Zimbabwe People First leader Joice Mujuru.When contacted for comment, Mr Mliswa confirmed that he indeed was set to take delivery of the vehicle under Parliament s revolving fund.The legislator defended his decision claiming he had gone through a Damascene moment. On hindsight, although I still subscribe to the point that Government should purchase vehicles locally, the fact that no initiatives have been implemented to this effect coupled with the realisation that I would be prejudicing my constituency from benefiting from the injection of a vehicle to carry out the many programmes I have lined up, I will accept the facility, said Mr Mliswa.Mr Mliswa said he still believed that Government should procure vehicles from Willowvale Mazda Motor Industry and other local assembling plants in line with the economic blueprint, Zim-Asset. Not only would production be boosted but the industry would thereby be in a position to be a medium for the much needed employment creation, he said.
