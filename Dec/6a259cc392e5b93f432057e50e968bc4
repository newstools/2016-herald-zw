Mehluli Sibanda in Moruleng, South AfricaFORMER Zimbabwe midfielder Esrom Nyandoro has expressed his disappointment with the Young Warriors side that crashed out at the on-going COSAFA Under-20 championship without a win in their group games. Nyandoro is at the tournament as an analyst for the television rights holders of the competition Kwese Sports. The former Amazulu and Mamelodi Sundowns midfielder reckoned that Zimbabwean lacked coordination and liked them to people who just met at the airport to go and represent the country . At some point I was left disappointed, obviously I love my country, I was rallying the boys to win, we all know that Zimbabwe national teams, Zimbabwe Under-20 and Under-23 were one of the powerhouses in Africa but with the game that we saw, I felt at some point the boys did not coordinate well, they were a bit disjointed, we did not click, we did not go to the next level the way we were playing. Maybe it might be the preparations, whether they were enough or not enough, but I always believe in anything you do you just need a good preparation. It looked like we just met at the airport and went to play a game, said Nyandoro.Nyandoro, who also captained the Warriors, said the COSAFA Under-20 tournament was an opportunity for the up and coming stars to showcase their talent, something they failed to do.Young Warriors coach Mandla Mpofu also invited Nyandoro to address the players just before their game against Malawi, but not even his presence in their dressing room could help give them the cutting edge they needed to win their second group game.Zimbabwe were in a three-team group that also included Zambia, who handed them a 5-1 drubbing. Meanwhile, the tournament had its group fixtures concluded yesterday at Moruleng and Mogwase Stadiums.Zimbabwean referee Nomore Musundire was the man in the middle when hosts South Africa took on Botswana in a Group A clash at Moruleng Stadium last night. In the two fixtures lined up for today, Zambia meet Mozambique at Mogwase while Malawi are up against Democratic Republic of Congo, with the winners of two matches finding their way to the semi-finals.The semi-finals are both scheduled for tomorrow at Moruleng Stadium, which is also the venue for the final on Friday evening.
