Geologists are asking for the domestication of the African Mining vision in all African country to drive investment and boost the continent s economy. The demand was made at the 26th Colloquium of African Geology, a major bi-annual Conference for the earth sciences held at the University of Ibadan. Not less than 32 countries were represented from different continents.The African Mining vision is a product of the largest assemblage of researchers, professionals, consultants, industrialists, investors and students in the earth science from all over the world with focus on the African continent.Organised by the Geological Society of Africa and hosted for the first time in Nigeria by the Nigerian Mining and Geosciences Society, this year s colloquium is set on Unlocking Earth Science Potentials for Sustainable Development of Africa and attended by 310 participants.Participants agreed that there must be a focused synergy between the academia, government and industry for the sustainable development of African mineral resources.The President of the Nigerian Society of Mining and Geo-Sciences, Professor Olugbenga Okunlola, noted that part of the task before the experts was the need to evolve an artisanal programme that would be inclusive of well-managed seed funding, extension outreaches, and equipment leasing initiatives in all active Mining countries starting with Nigeria. The colloquium is to bring together all Geo-scientists from all over the world that are working in Africa to discourse advancements in Geo-sciences in Africa. Everything relating to the study of rocks and the mineralisation, environmental effects and how it affects the standard of living in Africa. It is a plus for us in Nigeria because it will open up Nigeria to the investment world, to the Geo-Scientific world, to the research world to come into Nigeria to a lot of things as far as the earth sciences and mineralisation of the country is concerned, he told the gathering.Professor Okunlola added that we are going to discuss African problems, the problems of Artisanal mining, problems of investment of mining in oil and gas, in solid mineral sector and water resources. How it can affect the growth of the continent.How we can use these resources to earn more money and improve the GDP and how we can mine sustainably .Some of the participants also disclosed that the colloquium was an avenue to share research findings on African mining issues and sustainable environment.A Professor of Geology from Ethiopia, Professor Asfawossen Asrat, added that the conference will expose scientists to robust deliberations on ways of harnessing earth science studies to alleviate poverty in Africa .The case of non-reclamation of abandoned mines dotting the African landscape was frowned at and calls were made for the need to enforce the environmental laws governing mining in Africa to minimise noticeable disasters that have become frequent in recent times.Experts at the Conference noted the need for quick development of Africa s Development minerals which were hitherto referred to as non-metallic minerals or low quality high tonnage minerals . These include but not limited to limestone, marble, clays, granites, sands, and agnominal like phosphate, gypsum, feldspars, and lignite which have been identified as low hanging fruits for quick investment opportunities.Participants believe that if properly harnessed these could provide over three million jobs over the next four years in Africa with countries like Nigeria and south Africa, benefiting most.The major highlights of technical sessions covered all the major areas of the earth sciences including oil and gas, sedimentology, water resources, Geo-tourism, development and metallic minerals.Over 230 abstracts for oral presentation were received and documented.The colloquium further recognised the necessity of the rapid development of earth science academic institutions in Africa to be able to provide the much needed capacity and manpower for research and the minerals industry whether oil, gas or the solid minerals.The UNESCO initiative of the African Earth Science Institution (ANESI) initiative was applauded but calls for its long term sustainability were made.At the General Assembly of the Geological Society of Africa, which took place on the last day of the conference, Professor Okunlola, a Professor of Geology, was elected the new President of the Geological Society of Africa for the next four years. The deliverable from the Colloquium include the fact that Africa remains the most attractive investment destination for mining, hence the need to fully domesticate in each African country, the African Mining vision.
