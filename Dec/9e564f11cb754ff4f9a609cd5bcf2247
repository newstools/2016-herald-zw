Blessing Malinganiza Herald Reporter Deputy Senate President and Politburo member Cde Chen Chimutengwende has urged members of Parliament to foster community development in their areas and participate in local activities if they are to be voted back into office. Speaking at the official launch of a sports tournament Kazembe Kazembe Challenge Cup in Mazowe at the weekend, Cde Chimutengwende said it was the duty of legislators to engage donors who funded projects in their areas. I have been a legislator for 26 years and most of the developments in my constituency including electrification were funded by donors I approached such as the Libyan Embassy. Kazembe (Zanu-PF Mazowe West Constituency Member of Parliament Ray Kazembe) is the first MP in this province to call me at such a function where he is doing something for the people who voted him into office. I urge other parliamentarians to follow suit, he said.Ngezi Platinum Stars coach and former Warriors player Tonderai Ndiraya, bemoaned the lack of investment in football at grassroots level saying it was impeding on efforts by local coaches to identify sporting talent at a tender age.Ndiraya, a former Dynamos Football Club legend, commended Kazembe s initiative, which he said would go a long way in deterring youths in the area from being involved in criminal activities.The tournament is funded by MP Kazembe.He said sport took children away from the streets, where they were tempted to abuse drugs and get involved in promiscuous activities. If children take sport seriously, they can make a living out of it. It is therefore important to give children this opportunity, Ndiraya said.The 39-year-old coach said sport, if taken seriously could be a form of employment, adding that he had been surviving on soccer.Speaking at the same event, MP Kazembe also said his initiative would go a long way in ensuring that youths in the area were not involved in criminal activities.
