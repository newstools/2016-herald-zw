Prof MoyoJustine Mudyambanje Correspondent&#8212; Individuals come and go, but the people remain. That s why Zimbabwe s Constitution recognises only the people as the only stockholders of power! One centre of power a mistake, so tweet Professor Jonathan Moyo on his Twitter handle. It is sad that Prof Moyo can still believe that he can mislead people of Zimbabwe with impunity.But here let us examine the reasoning in which Prof Moyo has attempted to apply in his attempt to hoodwink the people of Zimbabwe behind his empty verbiage which is the worst of political rhetoric one can ever think of.To start with, the above statements are intended to imply that within the Zimbabwean political arena, it is only the civilians that endure and that the Constitution of Zimbabwe is based on his truism.The professor also tries to imply that only those he claims to be his partners in G40 are the most loyal to President Mugabe, while those with war credentials and who were in trenches with the President have suddenly become disloyal to their Commander-in-Chief.The professor likes to paint a picture that he has repented to the extent of exceeding those who fought for the liberation of this country during the time he was commiserating with the Americans.The professor regards the military and war veterans as some of those temporal institutions that do not endure or institutions that are in perpetual transitions.Those who have done a bit of philosophy can automatically realise that Prof Moyo is committing a fallacy of misplaced concreteness.This fallacy was committed because the security of the country was deliberately abstracted from the people who are thus postulated by Prof Moyo as the only guarantors of the constitution (a constitution which he was previously hell bent at refusing its formal adoption!).After committing this fallacy of misplaced concreteness, Prof Moyo went on to say that the Zimbabwean Constitution recognises only people as the stockholders as opposed to the military which constitutes a group of those who belong to the category of stakeholders.For reasons that are best known to him and to those who probably whisper secretly into his ears, he decides to separate the military from the stockholders of the people and the Constitution.It is common knowledge that without institutions such as the courts and the security machinery that are set in place to uphold and protect the Constitution, Zimbabwe will remain in a perpetual state of internal anarchy and thus rendering it vulnerable from covert and explicit attacks from external forces.Zimbabwe Defence Forces commander General Dr Constantino Guvheya Chiwenga was right when he said the military were stockholders of the Constitution and security guarantors .The implication of Gen Chiwenga s pronouncement here was that a country will always need its security if it is to defend its sovereignty from inside and outside threats.A superb constitution is not an automatic guarantee for its own objective endurance, rather it needs to be zealously protected by those institutions of society that have been mandated to do so in the original agreement that was entered when the path to nationhood was originally charted.In this regard, when Gen Chiwenga said the military were the stockholders of the Constitution, he implied that the military will always remain there as it is its mandate to protect the country.For example, within the business environment, the natural environment and none stockholders are usually referred to as stockholders.Share owners can always migrate with their monies somewhere on the basis of the profits and losses, and yet the stock will remain there as the only realities that endure.The same applies within the sphere of politics.When the individual politicians realise that his or her political fortunes, are no more satisfying his or her political ambitions, they usually move on within a short space period of time.For example, it is common knowledge in Zimbabwe that previously when Prof Moyo felt that Zanu-PF had its own plans that were not commensurate with his political plans for Tsholotsho, he decided to disobey the directives of Zanu-PF (that the constituency should be given to women) and went to stand as an independent candidate who single-handedly bankrolled his own political campaign.Today, the professor continues to tweet party issues on social media, defying directives of the very same President he vehemently claims to be exceptionally loyal to.These examples show that within Zanu-PF he was a stakeholder and not a stockholder.Also, even though Prof Moyo promulgated legislation such as AIPPA and Posa, as stakeholder within Zanu-PF he did not hesitate to abandon those policies which were his own brainchild!In 2014-2015, he as a stakeholder in Zanu-PF started attacking AIPA and Posa regardless.It is well-known that Prof Moy studied in the US and I think he is in a better position to know that the Pentagon and other US national security institutions are the stockholders of the USA as a nation and they are more knowledgeable in protecting solely what is usually considered to be the US national interests from within and without threats.The Pentagon and other US security institutions protect US interests at all costs even though doing so maybe against the constitutionally guaranteed individual liberties.In this regard, General Dr Chiwenga could not be bettered when he referred the military as our national insurance that will remain there to guarantee the safety of all that which we hold so dearly as a nation.The General has never doubted in his career the one centre of power as recently exhibited by the proverbial loyalist Prof Moyo.The General made it clear that the military as stockholders have their interests residing in the country and for that matter the military as an institution has nowhere to go.The General, who is an academic, further stated that the military, as stockholders, has war veterans of the liberation struggle.It shall continue to have war veterans such as those who participated in Mozambique and DRC campaigns.Thus the military as stockholders will continue to defend Zimbabwe s sovereignty and national interests for generations while stakeholders like Prof Moyo may decide otherwise.And who is Prof Moyo; a stakeholder who abandoned the revolution and a politician who despised his country s President by releasing what could be said state secrets to WikiLeaks.Many political scientists view the professor as a political sapien and social predator of peaceful order. Someone must have wrongly whispered into his ear that he was a great political strategist in Zanu-PF.The learned professor must know that his Machiavellian way of attacking those who oppose his chameleonic political strategies is deadly harmful and poisonous to his political life and that of Zimbabwe at large.The nation must remember that he accused Mutsvangwa of stealing women underpants on linen lines during the struggle.It must be made clear that the war was not a dynasty and did not have dormitories where comrades had the luxury of washing their clothes as the professor wanted the nation to believe. This was an insult to the institution of War Veterans especially coming from a minister of government.The professor as someone who schooled in USA must be aware that the straitjacket political policy was started in America and at some point American politicians were assassinated by stockholders for failing to fit into the concepts and values of the strait acket. Unfortunately, the professor seems to be passionately passing on this American draconian culture to some politicians in Zanu-PF who now practise alien character assassination of comrades they perceive to be opposed to their anthropological strategy of capturing state power from within. It should be known that the professor has a passion of hating war veterans including the President whom he wanted to resign as outlined by his utterances on Wiki-Leaks. Thus Zimbabweans, particularly youths, must be cautioned against following individuals like Jonathan Moyo who claim to be revolutionary stockholders when in fact they are of selling out the revolution like they did through Wiki-leaks. Handei tione. Let it play!Justin Mudyambanje is a living legend of the liberation struggle whose Chimurenga name was Mabhunu Muchapera.
