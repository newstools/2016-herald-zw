Fungai Lupande Court Reporter&#8212;AN Apostolic Faith Mission Ruwa pastor, Oliver Makomo, who is accused of raping a congregant, was yesterday removed from remand after the State failed to give him a trial date. Makomo s lawyer, Mr Nickel Mushangwe, said he was advised that the docket was sent to the Prosecutor-General s Office because of insufficient evidence. I am surprised that there is no communication from the PG s Office on the position of the docket, said Mr Mushangwe. The accused appeared in court on August 25 this year and State made numerous promises to provide a trial date. Prosecutor Ms Audrey Chogumaira argued that defence council was not being truthful about the PG s Office being mum about the docket. It is not true that there is no communication, they said they are still deliberating and will be able to furnish the accused with a trial date in two weeks, she said.Harare magistrate Ms Rumbidzai Mugwagwa ruled that there was no prejudice for State to proceed by way of summons.She removed Makomo from remand.It is alleged that sometime in 2012, Makomo (49) visited the complainant (22) at her work- place.The court heard that he asked for her phone number and they started communicating before asking if she was still virgin.Sometime in 2013, the complainant contacted the pastor to get help with her nose bleeding problem.Makomo allegedly invited her to his church office located at No.2 Gallowway Estate in Ruwa and prayed for her.After the prayer session, Makomo reportedly locked the door and proceeded to hug, kiss and insert his fingers into the complainant s private parts.She did not reveal the sexual assault to anyone.Sometime in 2013, Makomo allegedly invited the complainant to his house where she slept over.During the night, Makomo allegedly sneaked into the guest bedroom where she was sleeping, spat an unknown liquid substance into her mouth and raped her.Again the complainant did not reveal the sexual abuse to anyone.The court heard that sometime in 2014, the complainant was invited to the pastor s house.His wife had gone to South Africa and during the night Makomo sneaked into her bedroom and raped her, it is alleged.On December 23, 2014 the complainant was invited again to the pastor s house where she was allegedly raped again.The complaint later revealed the sexual assault to her boyfriend on August 22 last year.The boyfriend allegedly confronted Makomo who reportedly asked for forgiveness.
