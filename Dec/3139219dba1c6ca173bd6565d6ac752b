Minister KasukuwereMunicipal ReporterTHE Harare City Council has been ordered to appoint a substantive town clerk and fill all the vacant posts to ensure smooth operations at town house. Addressing the media after presenting a Special Audit of Harare City Council to councillors at Town House on Monday, the Minister Local Government, Public Works and National Housing Saviour Kasukuwere said the audit showed that over 40 council officials continued to earn obscene salaries in defiance of a Government directive setting ceiling for the highest paid employee at $10 450.He expects the city to study the report. Minister Kasukuwere noted that council was working under difficult circumstances and needed to be nursed. We want the city to move forward not to spend its time fighting and arguing. We also have three quarters of management in acting positions, he said. I want to appeal to Mayor (Bernard Manyenyeni) and your team never again to allow such events to continue happening in this city. In as much as we want to look after the top officials, we must also look at those at the bottom of the pyramid. I am aware that Harare City workers have not been receiving salaries. This is a collective responsibility that we have on all our shoulders to make sure that we lighten the burden to those on the bottom of this pyramid, he said. We want potholes to be filled in Harare. We want roads to be attended to, water and the hospitals must function. These are the key priorities and this is what we want to see Harare do. If they continue to be a squabbling lot then they become a nuisance to all of us, he said.
