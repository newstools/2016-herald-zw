LONDON. &#8211; Patrick Vieira claims Jose Mourinho s problems at Manchester United could be down to the manager s inability to deal with a new generation of player. Although the Portuguese insists United have progressed since he arrived at Old Trafford in the summer, disappointing results have left the once dominate force in the Premier League in sixth place &#8211; trailing Mourinho s former club Chelsea by 13 points. Vieira, who played under Mourinho at Inter Milan, suggested that his former boss needs to adapt to cope with a new breed of footballer that is no longer afraid of him.The former Arsenal captain, who is now head coach at New York City FC, accepts Mourinho inherited a difficult challenge but questioned if his confrontational approach still worked with younger players. It s very difficult for him, Vieira told radio station RMC. When you arrive in Manchester with the seasons they have had before with (Louis) Van Gaal and (David) Moyes, it s a bit more difficult. I don t know if he s lost the plot. I don t think he s changed his philosophy or tactics. I think he s got the same approach, because he s always about confrontation, he s the boss. Perhaps his players aren t as receptive, that the generation has completely changed. At Inter, we were quite an experienced group and he handled it well. The problem is almost certainly that there is a new generation and the message does not go through as well because there are players who perhaps stand up to him and perhaps aren t afraid to say what they think. That makes things more difficult. United returned to winning ways with a 2-0 victory at Zoyra on Thursday evening to ensure qualification into the knockout stages of the Europa League. &#8211; Mailonline.
