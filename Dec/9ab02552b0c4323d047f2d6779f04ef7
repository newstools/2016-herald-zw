NEW YORK. &#8211; The United Nations Security Council yesterday voted unanimously to tighten sanctions against North Korea following its most recent nuclear test, placing a cap on Pyongyang s coal exports to China. The new sanctions resolution, which was spearheaded by the United States and came after three months of tough negotiations with fellow veto-wielding council member China, passed by a 15-0 vote.The resolution aims to curb North Korea s coal exports &#8211; the top external revenue source for the impoverished state &#8211; by more than 60 percent, a US official said earlier.The official voiced hope that the resolution would cut $700 million from North Korea s coal earnings, dramatically reducing the money it can use on nuclear and ballistic weapons.China is North Korea s primary ally and one of the few markets for its coal.China has traditionally protected North Korea diplomatically, believing that Kim Jong-Un s regime is preferable to its collapse, but has increasingly grown frustrated by the state s defiance.The UN Security Council resolution condemns in the strongest terms North Korea s latest test on September 9. Pyongyang claimed at the time it had made major strides in its efforts to fit a miniaturized warhead on a rocket that could reach the United States. &#8211; AFP.
