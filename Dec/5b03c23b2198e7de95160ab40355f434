MANCHESTER. Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho claims the festive fixture schedule heavily favours his former club Chelsea, but believes there is no point approaching the English Premier League to complain. Mourinho was shocked to discover that Antonio Conte s English Premier League soccer leaders will play their three seasonal games over 10 days, compared to eight days for United and Arsenal and seven for Liverpool.Chelsea already benefit from not being involved in European football and Mourinho feels their kinder Christmas schedule gives them an additional advantage. Why? I don t know either, Mourinho said when asked if he could explain the inconsistency. I m not speaking about Chelsea; it happened the same with Liverpool a couple of years ago and this year too. (But) a team not playing in European competitions has a big advantage for sure. If on top of that when there is a first possibility of congestion with fixtures, if in that period they don t have it, obviously it makes a difference. You don t need to be a scientist to understand that to play with one day s rest is different to playing with four days rest. It s completely different. For me, the point is why? But over the years nobody really answered me because I had this also when I was in Chelsea. Mourinho was also pressed as to whether he, or United, have made representation to the Premier League over what appears to be a significant advantage for Conte s in-form side. No. They do what they want, said Mourinho, ahead of his side s Boxing Day clash with Sunderland yesterday. They will give excuses that TV, they have their choice. So it s not the Premier League, it s Sky, it s BT. AFP
