A sample of a pre-paid water meterPatrick Chitumba Bulawayo Bureau &#8212; KWEKWE City Council, which failed to install prepaid water meters this year, said the project will be implemented next year. The council was forced to defer implementing the project following controversy over the awarding of the tender project. Council was last year forced to cancel the $300 000 tender it had awarded to a Harare company following a public outcry over the adjudication process.It then invited fresh bids in April this year, but up to now, it has not awarded the tender. Mayor Councillor Matenda Madzoke said the project would go ahead next year. He said councillors were still to be briefed on the outcome of the tender process. The prepaid water meters project will definitely be implemented next year, he said.Clr Madzoke said council hoped to have finalised the awarding of the tender for the project next month after which the project can be implemented. The first bidding process of the pre-paid water meters was aborted after councillors protested the decision to award the contract for 200 prepaid water meters to a company called Tricon Investments at a cost of $340 000.Councillors queried why management had picked Tricon Investments when other bidders like Snylak (Pvt) Ltd and Merchant Links had tabled cheaper bids of $210 852 and $231 707 respectively. Councillors also argued that Tricon Investments meters had failed to meet the tender specifications outlined by council.&nbsp;
