LONDON. &#8211; Jurgen Klopp has been forced to defend Liverpool s character and title credentials after their incredible meltdown in a stunning 4-3 defeat at Bournemouth. Liverpool s shock loss on Sunday came at a time when they looked set to move to within a point of English Premiership soccer leaders Chelsea and go into the Christmas period as one of the favourites to finish as champions for the first time since 1990.However, the nervous manner of the team s late collapse against a Bournemouth team who had never won against Liverpool in their history, has opened up a debate over whether Klopp s squad is ready for such pressure. Next weekend sees Liverpool face lowly West Ham at Anfield, but the Christmas fixture list also throws up far tougher games against Merseyside rivals Everton and title rivals Manchester City, with star player Philippe Coutinho missing all of them because of an ankle injury.Klopp, however, sees no reason for panic despite his team conceding three goals in the last 14 minutes to turn a 3-1 lead into a 4-3 loss. We have no attitude or character problem, he said. No-one is born a winner. Not in the first two or three months. You have to learn it. It doesn t feel too good right now but sometimes we need it. So I m not angry. These things happen and you cannot be champions in December. I would say we were 100 percent before now. Now we are 99 percent. But it s quite simple to go back to 100 percent. &#8211; AFP.&nbsp;
