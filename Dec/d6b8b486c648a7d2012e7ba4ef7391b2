YOKOHAMA. Cristiano Ronaldo powered Real Madrid to the Club World Cup crown as they downed a gutsy Kashima Antlers 4-2 in the final at the Nissan Stadium in Yokohama yesterday. Los Blancos struck first through Karim Benzema but a brace from Gaku Shibasaki saw the Japanese outfit go ahead but their impossible dream was snuffed out as Ronaldo responded with a hattrick.Antlers had the honour of being the first Japanese side to reach the final of this particular tournament and they did themselves proud against the European Champs.South Africa s Mamelodi Sundowns can take some comfort from the fact that although they lost in the quarter-final it was to a team that made it all the way to their competition s showpiece and performed so admirably.
