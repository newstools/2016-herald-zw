JOHANNESBURG. &#8211; AB de Villiers has decided to step down as captain of the Proteas Test cricket team with immediate effect. De Villiers was appointed in January following Hashim Amla s resignation, and led the team in two Test matches against England before injury forced him to miss the series against New Zealand and Australia at the beginning of the 2016/2017 season. Commenting on his decision, De Villiers said: The interests of the team must always outweigh the interests of any individual, including me. It was a fantastic honour for me to be asked to captain the Test side but I have missed two series and I am still in doubt for the upcoming series against Sri Lanka. Following the squad s outstanding performances in Australia, it is clearly in the greater interests of the team that Faf du Plessis should be confirmed as the permanent Test captain. &#8211; Sport24.
