LONDON. Arsenal are preparing to make a sensational offer to bring Chelsea outcast Cesc Fabregas back to the Emirates Stadium. Arsene Wenger is keen to keep his Premier League title challenge on track and is ready to offer Fabregas a way out of his Stamford Bridge hell. The Spanish international has hardly featured since Antonio Conte took over at Stamford Bridge last summer when he switched formations.Fabregas has only made six first team appearances this campaign despite scoring two goals in those games. Wenger is looking for reinforcements and is looking at making an offer for Fabregas who started his career with The Gunners where he won the FA Cup in 2005.Fabregas would be an ideal replacement for Santi Cazorla who is out of action for the next three months following surgery.
