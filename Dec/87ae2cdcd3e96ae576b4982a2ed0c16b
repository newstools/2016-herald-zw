This year s awards would be dedicated to Kiki Divaris, the late patron of Miss Zimbabwe trust who Mushaninga said was a pillar of strength in the industry. She was instrumental in shaping the industry. She helped the models since the 1980s and she was very passionate about modelling, said Mushaninga.Several people will be awarded for different roles they played in the modelling industry. Of cause, there were challenges while organising this year s edition, said Rose.It was one of the reasons which resulted in the late submission of profiles by the nominated models. There were a few issues but were resolved. Some models submitted their profiles late and some even failed to bring forward their portfolios, she said.Winners will walk away with trophies and by winning the award, they are expanding their brand.
