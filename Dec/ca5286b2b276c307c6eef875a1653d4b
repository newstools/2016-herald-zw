Crime Reporter The Zimbabwe Republic Police will increase the number of undercover officers deployed to monitor the conduct of traffic police officers as part of a raft of measures to curb corruption, a senior police officer said yesterday. Chief police spokesperson Senior Assistant Commissioner Charity Charamba said the police force did not condone any form of corruption and those found engaging in such practices would be arrested, prosecuted and dismissed.She was addressing officers who were attending a press and public relations evaluation workshop in Harare recently. Some of the measures that have been put in place include that no traffic police officers would be deployed in a private car and that they should also declare at the station all the money on them before deployment. There are also teams that operate undercover targeting those on the roads, Snr Asst Comm Charamba said.Last year alone, 320 police officers were fired for various offences bordering on abuse of office.Snr Asst Comm Charamba said through their website and WhatsApp platform, they were receiving tip-off sfrom the public.She said it was an offence for motorists, especially kombi drivers, to offer or give bribes to traffic officers.Snr Asst Comm Charamba said police spokespersons had a duty to ensure symbiotic and cordial relations that exist between the police and the public were main- tained. There is therefore need for you to build confidence between the police and the society to realise cohesion in policing. As the face of the Zimbabwe Republic Police, you therefore have a call of duty to ensure that this confidence is nurtured and maintained, she said.
