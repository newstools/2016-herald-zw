BRISBANE. &#8211; Pakistan have never won a Test cricket series in Australia and last claimed a Test Down Under more than two decades ago but Mickey Arthur s squad are confident they can end at least one of those droughts over the next four weeks. That the three-match series commences with the first day-night Test at Brisbane s Gabba tomorrow adds an element of unpredictability to the start of the contest that the tourists will hope to exploit against an Australian side in transition.For their part, the hosts will be hoping to maintain Brisbane as the fortress it has been since they last lost a Test there in 1988 and for the extra pace and bounce of the home wickets to confound touring batsmen and bowlers alike.Pakistan coach Arthur knows plenty about Australian conditions having coached the men in the baggy green from 2011 to his sacking in 2013, and is convinced he has the weapons at his disposal to hurt the hosts. - Reuters.
