PARIS. Come 9pm today, what looks to be a poorly kept secret will officially be out Cristiano Ronaldo will bag his fourth Ballon d Or as the world s top footballer. The Real Madrid and Portugal star won the Champions League for the second time in three seasons and third time overall after one title with Manchester United in 2008.He then led Portugal to their first major title at Euro 2016 albeit he went off early through injury in the win over France.As has been the case for almost a decade now, the 31-year-old s main rival will be Lionel Messi of Barcelona but the Argentine maestro has had by his own exalted standards a less than stellar year both for club and country with the top prizes eluding him on both fronts.
