MELBOURNE. Pakistan s opening batsman Azhar Ali has rarely seemed a man in a hurry in six years of Test cricket so it was fitting that his 12th century was eked out in fits and starts over two rainy days at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Azhar s unbeaten 139 pushed Pakistan to 310 for six at the end of day two of the second Test against Australia yesterday and was a triumph of patience and determination in the face of frustrating rain delays and a world class pace attack.The ton lifted the gritty 31-year-old past 1 000 runs for the year, a milestone shared by only four others from the south Asian nation.He is also within striking range of Majid Khan s 158 at the same ground in 1972, the highest score by a Pakistan player in Australia. The rain has crimped the tourists hopes of forcing a result to keep the three-match series alive after their 39-run loss in the Brisbane opener. But Azhar may have at least won over more fans, having left some cold with his one-dimensional, blue collar batting style. Reuters.
