Lloyd ChitembweTedious Manyepo and Paul Mundandi ZIMBABWE S CAF Champions League representatives CAPS United have decided not to tamper with their title-winning squad as they anxiously wait to know who their opponents will be when the continent s soccer mother body conduct the draw in Cairo, Egypt, this afternoon. There had been indications that some star players at the Green Machine, including defender Stephen Makatuka and reigning Soccer Star of the Year Hardlife Zvirekwi, were on their way from the Lloyd Chitembwe-coached team, but The Herald understands all those players have made a U-turn as they are relishing probably their only chance of playing in the lucrative Champions League.Makatuka, who had set his sights on playing in the South African Mvela League with Amazulu, has committed his future to Makepekepe, so is Warriors right-wing back Zvirekwi, who was understood to be eyeing a switch to the Tanzanian Premiership.Veteran striker and the 2016 Golden Boot winner Leonard Tsipa has also vowed to stay at CAPS United despite having gone to Tanzania, where he was recently club-hunting.Lanky goalkeeper Chris Mverechena, who was out on loan to Chibuku Super Cup and the country s CAF Confederations Cup poster team Ngezi Platinum Stars, has also returned to the team and joins fellow goalminders Edmore Sibanda and Jorum Muchambo.CAPS United chief executive Cuthbert Chitima said the team s administrative structures are content with all the players they have in their books and believe their desire to succeed will drive them to the Promised Land.Chitima hinted that Makepekepe could add some few new signings in their fold before the CAF Champions League s December 31 player registration deadline. We are going to sit down with our coach on Thursday and see if there is a real need to beef up our squad. The honest truth is that we are retaining the bulk of the squad (that helped us to win the 2016 league title) unless otherwise something happens. A lot has been said about our players leaving the team but we are not in a panic mode. At times it is the Press that just give us the pressure during this off-season period. We are retaining our players and even Chris (Mverechena) is coming back home, said Chitima.Although CAPS United are mum on their target signings, they are believed to be chasing the signature of Dynamos leftback Ocean Mushure as well as Triangle s exciting attacking midfielder Marlvin Gaki.Chitembwe is a known big admirer of Mushure and he believes his experience will be a vital cog to his side s cause in the African Safari. The CAPS United gaffer is also probably looking at other clubs rejects as he is known to do well with players deemed excess by other teams.In the just-ended Premiership season, he has revived the careers of Joel Ngodzo, Tsipa, Domnic Chungwa, Devon Chafa and goalkeeper Sibanda. Chungwa was off-loaded by Dynamos, with Ngodzo being thrown to the dust bin by his childhood team Highlanders but Chitembwe somehow breathed life back into their careers and they are now among some of the most-sought-after players on the domestic scene. I might get two or three players but the truth is at the moment I am giving all the attention to my family. I just want to rest and I will be back to work in 12 days time. I am going to meet with my players and technical team on January 2 for a braai. We will start our pre-season training on January 3 and I would like to wish everyone a Merry Christmas and a Prosperous New Year and may the Lord bless everyone, said the championship-winning coach.Meanwhile, CAPS United are set to get a huge financial reward if they win the CAF Champions League title after CAF increased the financial rewards in a new format with the prize for the winners increasing by 66,6 percent to $2,5 million.The runners-up will receive $1,25 million, semi-finalists $875 000, quarter-finalists $650 000 and the eight-group qualifiers who fail to make it to the knockout stage will get $550 000 each.CAF have cut the two-leg qualifying phase from three rounds to two and doubled the number of qualifiers for the mini-leagues from eight to 16. Clubs eliminated at the last-32 stage of qualifying get a second shot at African glory by dropping to the Confederation Cup, which star-studded TP Mazembe of the Democratic Republic of Congo won this season.The precise number of 2017 entrants is unknown with CAF giving no pre-draw information on their website.After some previous qualifying rounds draws, there has been an unexplained delay of several days before they are released.While the 54-member states and associates Reunion and Zanzibar are eligible to enter one or two clubs, depending on previous results, financial constraints prevent some of them from doing so.
