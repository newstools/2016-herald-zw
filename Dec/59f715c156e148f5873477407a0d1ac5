BARCELONA. A never-say-die approach is part of Real Madrid s DNA, said captain Sergio Ramos after his stoppage time equaliser maintained a six-point Spanish La Liga lead over Barcelona with a 1-1 draw in El Clasico on Saturday. Ramos strode forward from defence to net another important goal after Luis Suarez s 53rd minute opener looked set to end Madrid s 32-game unbeaten run. The team has again showed that we came here to win the game, it wasn t to be but we got a point, said Ramos. At the end of the day the DNA of Real Madrid obliges you to fight until the end, to always have hope. Ramos s header was a hammer blow for Barca, who have now dropped more points at home already this campaign than they did in the whole of last season. It shows that we have done things well since the start of the season, but we can t go crazy, added Ramos. AFP
