Dee NoshArts Correspondent Several musicians have castigated promotional company 2 Kings Entertainment for offering $50 to Sniper Storm as performance fee at Jah Cure gig over the weekend. A recording that has gone viral shows a representative of 2 Kings, Vee Jay offering Sniper $50 to perform at the show.Vee Jah advised the Kwarira Mukati singer to delete his number if he fails to take the offer.Musicians who refused to be named said it was a big sign of disrespect to the artistes by the promotional company. It s surprising how promoters get carried away and don t see that they are just the same as the artistes they seek to exploit in many respects. As an artiste, today you have hits, tomorrow you don t, as a promoter, today you have a sponsor, tomorrow you don t. Build relationships, be fair, it will help when chips are down, a manager from a local musical group said.Others said it was it was unfair for the promoter to treat Jamaican musicians like gold yet failing to honour local musicians. Jamaican musicians are treated like kings but what does it mean if a promoter offers such an amount for a musician? They should respect us, he said.Vitalis Hungwe a promoter-cum-musician said it was an insult to upcoming musicians. Honestly to elevate Jamaicans at the expense of our own is not acceptable, he said.However, other artistes said it was important for musicians to engage promoters on time. There is need for proper arrangements not to call the promoter on the day of the show asking to perform. That is very unprofessional, he said.Others blasted Sniper for showing desperation to the promoter.Sniper manager Chido Musasiwa is on record saying the musician worked for his brand and that was an insult.2 Kings Entertainment boss Dee Nosh refused to comment on the matter.
