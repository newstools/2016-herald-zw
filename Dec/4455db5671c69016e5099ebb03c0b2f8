Usually people do not realise the money is spending when they are swiping until there is only $10 left in the bank account and you start to panic. Make a list of the things that you really need and prioritise them, she said.Festive season is also characterised by parties, new clothes, presents and gifts for loved ones as well as increased travel expenses with families visiting relatives in rural areas or resort towns.This tradition is deeply rooted in many Zimbabweans, who are also hit hard on disposable incomes following failure by many companies to declare the 13th cheque for their employees due to economic challenges.In some instances, parents struggle to meet tuition fees or make bill payments on time and battle a huge debt overhang created to fund extravagant holidays.Ms Siyachitema highlighted consumers need to look ahead of the festive season to avoid headaches in the New Year.
