Cde ChomboTichaona Zindoga Political Editor&#8212; zanu-pf members seeking to either challenge President Mugabe s authority or propose changes to the party s constitution must come out in the open and test their popularity, Secretary for Administration Cde Ignatius Chombo has dared. In interview ahead of the party s 16th National People s Conference to be held in Masvingo from December 13 to 17, Cde Chombo said the one centre of power principle anchored on the party s First Secretary was intact.He touted the party s democratic credentials saying members were free to raise issues they felt were important. He also acknowledged the existence of factionalism in the party, but said such ructions were not enough to destroy it. I can categorically state that the one centre of power, in this particular case the centre being President Robert Mugabe, is very much intact. It is cemented and there is absolutely no doubt about it, said Cde Chombo. I know there are some malcontents out there who wish it was not so but this is what it is. The President is very much in charge and in control, very much loved and preferred. I would dare anybody who thinks he or she has clout to come in and stand against the President. That person will be beaten to shreds like a prodigal child. He explained that as a democratic party, zanu-pf gave districts power to assess the performance of the party and make recommendations. Everyone has the freedom to raise anything. The issue is will others support you in what you are bringing forward? If it is a good idea, you will get traction. If it is not a good idea, it will dry in the wind. That is how things work. We are a democratic party and system, he said.He went on: There is one centre of power, that is why we changed the constitution. But if you want to recommend a change of the constitution, you also have to bring your own arguments and we don t shy away from them, they make the party strong. We are very clear.
