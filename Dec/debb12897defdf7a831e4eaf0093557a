Crime Reporter &#8212; South African Police Services (SAPS) on Wednesday intercepted criminals who were smuggling goods across the Limpopo into Zimbabwe. The incident occurred barely a week after three suspected car jackers were arrested by South Africa police smuggling stolen vehicles into Zimbabwe.According to the SAPS, the Limpopo Provincial Commissioner Lieutenant General Nneke Ledwaba led an aerial operation that resulted in the interception of goods that were on their way to Zimbabwe. A donkey cart was spotted from a police helicopter conveying goods towards the Zimbabwe side of the Limpopo River, said the SAPS on its website. The suspects, when noticing a police helicopter landing on the river bank, fled into Zimbabwe, leaving the donkeys and the cart in the dryer portion of the Limpopo River. The origin of these items, which include groceries, is still being investigated and no arrest has been made. This is the second achievement of an operation led by the provincial commissioner. Last week, a motor vehicle that was reported stolen in Durban was abandoned by the suspects in the middle of the Limpopo River together with five donkeys that were used to pull it through the water. The suspects fled after they were spotted from a police helicopter. The SAPS recently launched a campaign dubbed Safer Festive Season Operations , which saw senior police officers involved in the fight against crime.
