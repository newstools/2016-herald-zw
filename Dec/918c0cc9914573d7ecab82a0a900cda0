The late Fidel CastroHAVANA. &#8211; Cuba-US relations are at a crossroads as fears arise that the death of Cuban revolutionary leader Fidel Castro may decelerate the normalisation of the ties and US President-elect Donald Trump s assuming power will bring uncertainties to the US policy on Cuba. Castro passed away last Friday in the Cuban capital of Havana at the age of 90.After writing blunt tweets about Castro s death last Friday, Trump on Monday further threatened to end US President Barack Obama s deal with Cuba on Twitter, urging Cuba to make a better deal for the Cuban people, the Cuban-American people and the US as a whole .Trump s statement issued hours after Castro s death was also filled with negative comments about the Cuban leader.Rafael Hernandez, Cuban political analyst and head of the Temas magazine, said Trump s statement was very inappropriate at this moment and cast a shadow on the future of the Cuba-US relations.Analysts say that although Castro was not the direct promoter of the normalisation of the Cuba-US ties, his death could enhance his spiritual effect on Cuba, which could decelerate bilateral rapprochement.Lv Yang, a researcher with China Institute of Contemporary International Relations, said Castro was always vigilant about the US Colour Revolution attempt to topple the Cuban government. Even after ceding power to his brother, Raul, Castro always published articles on Granma, the official newspaper of the Central Committee of the Cuban Communist Party, to criticise US policy, Lv said.After Cuba and the United States re-established diplomatic relations in December 2014, Castro wrote articles to remind his party comrades of the US plot of peaceful evolution, he added.Havana lost reassurance after Castro passed away, Lv said, adding that Cuban policymakers, whether reformists in favour of Cuba-US rapprochement or conservatives against the detente, will become more prudent in dealing with US-related issues. The Cuban government will also invest in more energy to handle Castro s funeral affairs, the expert said.Experts say that the normalisation of the Cuba-US ties is an irresistible trend but faces challenges as Trump could change the US policy towards Latin American countries including Cuba, which would add uncertainties to the future of the Cuba-US ties. &#8211; Xinhua.
