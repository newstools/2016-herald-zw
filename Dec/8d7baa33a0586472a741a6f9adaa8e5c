Two teenagers armed with pistols shot him in the head after he got off his car, Hassan Ahmed, a waiter at the restaurant, told Reuters. His bodyguards fired back, but the killers had already disappeared by then, he said.Abdifatah Haji Aden, Chairman of Puntland s military court, said: We believe it was the same militants who killed the other two officials last week that also killed him.
