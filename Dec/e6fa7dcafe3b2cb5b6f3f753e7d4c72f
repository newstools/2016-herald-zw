Sports Reporter&#8212;BORROWDALE Racecourse will host the last race of the year, the Zimbabwe Challenge, over 1 450m this Sunday. The race will see the resumption of the rival between stables and all eyes will be on former star Flax. Flax has to date won only once at Borrowdale Park and that was in the 1 450m Breeders Sprint back on July 31 and will face competition from stable-mate Mathematician.Zimbabwe Horse of The Year, Mathematician, won four races from 1 300m to 2 400m, but judging by their previous experience over this trip, Flax probably has the edge.Bridget Stidolph s charge will be expected to do well on Sunday after both runners took part in the 1 200m HRIB Gold Cup on December 3 and trailed.Sheik s Brashee from the Penny Fisher yard will also be in the starting stalls but is yet to win beyond 1 200m.He finished third in the HRIB, 2,60 lengths behind.The son of The Sheik was beaten by Flax at level weights in the Breeders Sprint. Now he receives 2kg and his recent form is excellent, but now need to handle the extra ground.All of Windigo, Madigan, Call Me Earl, La Carmelita and Newton Power come in at 53,5kg or below.Newton Power (52kg) has won over Sunday s distance both at Borrowdale and Turffontein and also clocked up a 1 400m victory at the Vaal.He was 1,75 lengths off Flax in the Breeders Sprint, at level weights, and last time out ran second to Road To Dubai in the HRIB. He has to be a real danger here.The other runners can be ignored at one s own peril as they will see out the trip with Madigan, for instance, she has been placed several times in this particular race, carrying much more than he will on Sunday.The outcome is probably going to depend on the conditions underfoot.
