LONDON. Britain s science and technology industries are expected to lead another leap in hiring next year, in another vote of confidence in the economy following the Brexit vote, according to the Confederation of British Industry. The country s jobs-rich recovery will be given a big boost as almost every part of the private sector hires more staff over the next 12 months, the UK s business group s annual employment survey found.The research showed 41 percent of companies expect to grow their workforces in 2017, compared with just 13 percent that believe their payrolls will shrink.It polled 353 large and small businesses employing almost 1.2 million people, and found that the pace of jobs creation is likely to be highest in science, IT and construction. At 28 percent, it is the sixth consecutive year where the balance of businesses that expect to add staff has been 20 percent or more.The survey also flies in the face of dire warnings from the Treasury, which said Brexit risked half a million job losses and the CBI s own commissioned report that warned before the referendum that leaving the EU could cost 950 000 jobs by 2020.Josh Hardie, deputy director of the CBI, said the UK s chronic skills shortage remained one of the biggest worries for the future , as well as access to highly skilled migrants if the UK limits immigration from the EU after Brexit.The survey also showed half of companies surveyed believed the UK will become less attractive over the next five years.
