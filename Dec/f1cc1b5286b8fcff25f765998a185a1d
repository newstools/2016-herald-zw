Sports Reporter&#8212;ZIMBABWE S Confederation Cup d butantes Ngezi Platinum could be without one of their key strikers James Nguluve amid revelations that the forward is on the verge of being snapped up by South African Premiership side Maritzburg United. Nguluve has been in South Africa for trials with Martizburg since last Thursday.Last night he watched his prospective club resuming their Premiership campaign with a date against Tendai Ndoro s Orlando Pirates at Harry Gwala Stadium night.Sources close to the deal said last night that Nguluve had so far impressed the Martizburg United technical crew even before the end of his 10-day trial.It also emerged that two other South African Premiership clubs are interested in the services of the striker, who scored five goals in Ngezi s debut season in the Premiership in which they finished seventh. Nguluve also played a starring role as he helped Ngezi defy the odds to lift the Chibuku Super Cup and with it a ticket to represent Zimbabwe in next year s Confederation Cup. James has been doing well since he started training with Maritzburg last weekend and it seems like a deal will soon be struck between Ngezi and Martizburg. He is also wanted by two other clubs in South Africa while there is also a chance for him to go to Europe so as it stands, it is highly unlikely that he will be returning to Zimbabwe for the 2017 Premiership season, the source said.Nguluve is not the only local player to have travelled to South Africa in search of a new club following the end of the 2016 season.Speedy Triangle winger Marlvin Gaki, goalkeeper Chris Mverechena, who had been on loan at Ngezi Platinum from CAPS United, How Mine defender Victor Kamhuka and ZPC Kariba forward Talent Chawapihwa are also in South Africa on club hunting missions.Should Nguluve seal his move to the Team of Choice, he could become the third Zimbabwean at Maritzburg, who already have the Warriors pair of striker Evans Rusike and defender Blessing Moyo.Rusike started in last night s match at Harry Gwala while Moyo, who has had some challenges with injuries was on the bench.Moyo was brought in towards the end of the game as Maritzburg, who led 2-1 sought to close shop for their first home victory of the season.Ndoro as has been the case in the current ABSA Premiership season led the line of attack for Pirates but the Premiership s leading scorer fired blanks on the night including a last gasp chance to draw his team level.
