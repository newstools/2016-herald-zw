Municipal Reporter Harare City Council is set to introduce the Harare (Public Health) (Amendment) by-laws 2016, which seek to regulate the number of chickens to be kept at a residential property depending on the size of the property. According to the proposed by-laws, residents in high-density suburbs would not be allowed to keep more than 25 chickens, and any person who fails to comply with any of the provisions of the by-laws upon conviction, would be liable to one year imprisonment.Environment Management Committee chairperson councillor Herbert Gomba said the by-laws were introduced after council received a number of complaints from residents about neighbours who kept chickens or other poultry at their premises.The chickens make noise, cause a stench and discomfort to the neighbours. The Harare (Public Health) By-laws S1582-62 needed to be updated to ensure that the number of chickens allowed per household is prescribed. Thereafter, authorities will be able to enforce the by-laws, he said.For properties below 300 square metres, a maximum of 25 chickens may be permitted, while residents with properties measuring between 300 to a maximum of 900 square metres can keep 100 chickens.For properties measuring 900 to 2000 square metres, a maximum of 405 chickens is allowed, and 800 chickens for properties measuring 2 000 square metres there- after.According to the by-laws, if a person wishes to keep more chickens, they have to apply for a permit.Upon receipt of the application for a permit, the director of Health Services shall together with the director of Works inspect the applicant s premises.Section 27 (7) says subject to the outcome of the inspection, the director may grant or refuse permit.The permit shall be valid for a period of one year from the date it was granted, and upon expiry, the applicant shall apply for renewal of the permit.Section 25 (9) grants authority to a health inspector or any other person authorised by council to confiscate all excess poultry found at a residential area.The confiscated poultry shall be stored at an area designated by council for such purposes for a period of seven days to allow the owner to claim them.The owner shall be allowed to collect the poultry upon payment of prescribed penalty charges, which shall be prescribed by council from time-to-time, to cater for storage and feeding expenses.Should the owner of the confiscated poultry fail to claim their property within seven days, council shall dispose of the birds as it deems necessary to defray expenses.According to the proposed by-laws, any person who contravenes or fails to comply with any of the provisions of the by-laws or knowingly gives false information shall be guilty of an offence and liable of conviction to a penalty not exceeding level five or one year imprisonment or, to both fine and imprisonment.
