Tedious Manyepo Sports Reporter&#8212;PREMIERSHIP giants Dynamos have dismissed the indaba being organised by the club s former sons Ernest Kamba and Eric Aisam, at Prince Edward next week, as yet another malicious attempt to wrestle power from the bona-fide leadership. The Kamba faction have been advertising a notice of an extraordinary meeting where, among the items on the agenda, they are looking at appointing a new board of directors as well as external auditors.Kamba and his partners have also called upon all Dynamos sons to come in their numbers for the meeting.But Dynamos board of directors chairman Bernard Marriot yesterday dismissed the purported meeting as yet another malicious and frivolous attempt to cause confusion and divisions in the club .Marriot said the Dynamos board and the club s executive led by Kenny Mubaiwa had begun reviewing the just-ended Premiership season and were also putting in place measures to ensure the fallen giants return to the top of the tree on the domestic game.DeMbare had a pathetic season by their standards and Marriot admitted as much but questioned the motive of the Kamba faction to rise when the results on the pitch have not gone DeMbare s way. It is true that we had a difficult season and it is not our style to finish fifth but every team goes through a slump and even in England Manchester United failed to secure a Champions League spot because they were not among the top four but it was no reason to try and change leadership. Where were these people when Dynamos was winning? It shows that they are a bunch of attention seekers who are trying to cause confusion at the club by calling for an illegitimate meeting. We just want our stakeholders to know that there is no such thing as an annual meeting of Dynamos at Prince Edward School or even an extraordinary meeting of the club. Due notice will be served through the proper structures and in line with the best business practices when a real Dynamos annual meeting is to be held, Marriot said.The Harare giants legal adviser Herbert Mutasa scoffed at the Kamba faction s antics saying they can choose to gather and have coffee but nothing binding will come out of that meeting From a legal point of view, anyone who is not a shareholder of the institution called Dynamos Private Limited cannot convene a meeting because they would be strangers to the system. Whatever comes out of that meeting is not binding to the team whatsoever. As far as I know, Bernard Marriot and the other shareholders can convene a meeting to discuss issues to do with Dynamos Private Limited, he said.
