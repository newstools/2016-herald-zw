Donald TrumpDave Londorff: CorrespondentThe New York Times and Washington Post, the nation s two top national newspapers, have been breathlessly reporting of late, with little sign of any appropriate journalistic skepticism, on a purported massive and successful Russian conspiracy to throw the US election to their favoured candidate, Donald Trump. But the Chicago Tribune has weighed in with a more measured piece, suggesting that while the CIA, a particularly secretive and politically driven organisation, may be making that claim, the FBI is not convinced.While even the Tribune sometimes ignores inserting the requisite alleged that should precede any reference to unproven claims that Russia is behind the hacking of the Democratic Party s (and the Republican Party s) e-mail server, the paper does also note that Democrats in particular are frustrated by the murky nature of the FBI s analysis, with outgoing Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), calling on FBI Director James Comey to resign.The reason for the Democrats frustration is also made clear. As the Tribune reports:With so much of the evidence about Russia s alleged role in the election shrouded in secrecy because of strict classification rules, Democrats and Republicans in Washington who have access to the underlying intelligence say they have struggled to make their respective cases, leaving an already deeply divided public convinced that both sides are shading their conclusions to help the candidate they backed on Election Day.The reality is that the CIA has presented no hard evidence that Russia is behind the hacking of the DNC s or Clinton s private home server. The excuse is given that the Agency doesn t want to disclose any of its sources, so the reader is left with the pathetic plea, from both the Agency and the White House: Trust us. But why would anyone trust the CIA or the White House on anything? We re talking about an agency and a Executive Branch that between them are known to have lied (during the GW Bush years) about anthrax labs in Saddam Hussein s Iraq, lied about what were aluminium tubes imported to make irrigation equipment being evidence of missile-building, lied about Iran s links to Al Qaeda, and (during the Obama years) lied about Syria s government using Sarin gas on its own people in Damascus, lied about the details of the killing of Osama Bin Laden, lied about the role of a murderous CIA agent captured by Pakistani police while posing as a US consular employee, lied about the extent of National Security Agency Spying both at home and abroad, and lied about Russia invading Ukraine and shooting down a civilian Malaysian jumbo jet.If one were to take a moment and think about what is being alleged here by Democrats that a national presidential election was successfully subverted by the releasing of hacked e-mails showing major corruption and malfeasance by the Democratic Party leadership in undermining the fairness of the party s presidential primary to benefit one candidate Hillary Clinton and to destroy the candidacy of her opponent Bernie Sanders it should lead to one of two alternative conclusions.Either the Russians did Americans a favour, by exposing the epic corruption of one of their two major parties and one of the candidates seeking to become president something that a more independent and aggressive domestic media would have and should have done on their own, if not by hacking then by paying attention to, instead of ignoring and blacking out, what frustrated insiders like DNC Vice Chair Tulsi Gabbard, the Democratic congresswoman from Hawaii who quit in disgust saying the DNC was undermining the primaries on behalf of Clinton s campaign. Or alternatively, we re being told that our 240-year-old democracy is so shrivelled and weak that an outside government can easily undermine it and manipulate the outcome as if we were some corrupt and fragile banana republic.Either conclusion is rather pathetic and depressing to contemplate.Meanwhile, the media feeding frenzy over unsubstantiated claims over Russian subversion of our last election ignores the reality that this kind of thing is something the US has been doing abroad at least since the end of World War II and the onset of the Cold War.Not content to just undermine elections through dirty tricks, fake news and secret payments in Europe, Latin America, later in Eastern Europe and Russia, and in Asia, the US has also fomented countless coups to overthrow or attempt to overthrow existing elected governments, most recently in Honduras, Ukraine, Venezuela and Brazil, and so has no grounds to complain by claiming that the Russians were allegedly doing the same thing here.On the other hand, if the Democratic Party leadership had kept its hand off the scale during the primaries, and had not made such heavy-handed efforts to get major news organisations like the Times, MSNBC, the Daily News, Post and others to help it undermine Bernie Sanders; Sanders would have won both the party s nomination and the presidency, and probably the Congress also into the bargain, and we wouldn t be looking at a looming Trump presidency and Republican Congress.Not only that, but with a genuinely popular candidate running for president in both parties (like it or not Trump was wildly popular among a significant segment of the population), no Russian propaganda campaign would have had a prayer of impacting voter opinion or the results of the voting.If indeed there really was a Russian effort to swing this recent election, it could only have succeeded in a situation where the electorate was disgusted by its choices and was voting negatively for a lesser evil.And that situation only could arise where the two major parties were so corrupted that they were trying desperately to keep genuinely popular candidates from winning the nomination.In fact that is what happened. The Republican leadership tried mightily to keep Donald Trump, a loose cannon who has disavowed many basic and long-held Republican principles, such as backing US empire and Israel, supporting any and all trade agreements, and viewing Russia as an existential enemy, from winning their party s nomination.They failed, but not for lack of trying. The Democratic leadership tried everything, too, to prevent insurgent self-described socialist candidate Sanders from winning the nomination, and thanks to underhanded manipulation of the primaries, corrupt meddling in media coverage of Sanders, an anti-democratic voting block of locked-in super delegates, committed to backing Clinton whatever the result of the primaries, and some crooked efforts to depress voting in key primary states including New York and California, they succeeded in throwing the nomination to Clinton. She of course was doomed, by their very ham-handed interference in the primaries, to go on to lose the general election.Dave Lindorff is a founding member of ThisCantBeHappening!, an online newspaper collective, and is a contributor to Hopeless: Barack Obama and the Politics of Illusion (AK Press).
