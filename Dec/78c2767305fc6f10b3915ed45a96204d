Jeremiah 29 vs 11 For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future. A couple of days ago I read a devotion that is common to the church I attend, and as I was reading it I was struck by the message. In order for King Saul to be proclaimed king he had to be chosen by God. When this happened he was shocked and he asked the Prophet Samuel why someone who was from the least of the twelve tribes of Israel could find favour with God. He didn t understand why he, out of everyone else, would be chosen and given the lofty mandate of leading God s people.We all have moments where we wonder, based on where we are, whether God will ever hear our prayers. We ask ourselves how He is going to pick our prayer among the millions of others and bestow favour on us .The truth is that in the middle of the crowd God has seen each one of us, He knows the plans he has for each one of us and at the right time He will pull you out of the crowd and say my precious child, it is time. So many people fail the test of growth because they choose to be impatient, they believe that God is not listening and that He is too busy dealing with the issues of the world to hear their endless cry. Saul was amazed at the sequence of events that led to his coronation, all perfectly scripted to the tee.Today you may be in doubt, wondering whether He can see you. Be assured that He can see you and He is putting the pieces of your story together. We all want to stand out and be noticed, but with the LORD we don t need to do the outrageous to get His attention.Wherever we are today He can see and hear us and He will take us forward from glory to glory.Rest assured that He cares and He is watching over you.Be blessed!For more info:Visit our website: www.thefig-tree.org &lt;http://www.thefig-tree.org&gt;Email us on: info@thefig-tree.org &lt;mailto:info@thefig-tree.org&gt;Catch us on StarFM, Monday to Friday at 0620hours&nbsp;
