Canadian singer Shania Twain said she liked to be surrounded by snow for the festivities. I come from a very cold part of Canada, so there s always snow. I like traditional Christmases . . . so I go for a pretty quiet low-key traditional Christmas environment. Actor Liam Neeson said he also favoured tradition: We celebrate Christmas, myself and my two sons very, very traditionally. Lots of food, maybe too much food, a few gifts and a few prayers too with thanks, certainly with thanks . . . It s a very important time of the year. However, at this month s 2016 Fashion Awards in London, rocker Marilyn Manson said he hates Christmas . I ve spent every Christmas without a Christmas tree . . . since some while, I m like Charlie Brown s Christmas &#8211; the sad tree, the Grinch, he said. &#8211; Reuters.
