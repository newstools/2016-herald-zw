ATHENS. Four prominent Greek and multinational food companies face the prospect of yanking goods from supermarket shelves during the Christmas holidays after a contamination threat by anarchists, police said yesterday. Clearly there will be a withdrawal, the companies will be issuing the relevant announcements, a police source told AFP. A group called Green Nemesis on Monday said it had tainted several dozen units of products by Coca-Cola, Nestle, Unilever and Greek dairy giant Delta. We have appropriated products from the main supermarket chains in the greater Athens area, the group said in a statement posted on an anti-establishment website. The products have been poisoned with chlorine and hydrochloric acid, it said.Authorities said Greece s anti-terror squad was looking into the case, and that the country s food safety watchdog had also been informed.
