NAIROBI. Kenyan officials seized nearly two tonnes of smuggled ivory after recalling a shipment en route to Cambodia following intelligence that it contained illegal cargo, a tax official said. The 1.97 tonnes of ivory, valued at $2 million, were hidden in hollow wooden planks and declared as ceramics, David Yego, Kenya Revenue Authority s commissioner for investigations, said on Wednesday. Authorities in Singapore returned the shipment to Mombasa after Kenya raised the alarm.Yego expressed concerns that the smugglers had been able to by-pass new security measures designed to stop narcotics and ivory smuggling at the port. The manner in which the tusks were concealed causes a concern to us, as to the manner in which ivory traffickers are adapting new tactics to avoid detection at ports. Reuters.
