Moussa SowSENEGALESE hitman, Moussa Sow, who is one of the big name forwards the Warriors are likely to confront at the 2017 Nations Cup finals in Gabon, underlined his class by scoring with another outrageous overhead kick in the UEFA Europa Cup last night. The big forward caught the attention of the world when he scored with an overhead kick to help Turkish giants Fenerbahce beat Manchester United in Istanbul last month. The 30-year-old Senegalese striker scored a sublime goal to help his side to a 2-1 Europa League victory over the Red Devils, which sparked a run of six wins on the bounce for the Turkish giants.The ball flew past David De Gea before he had a notion what was happening.Then Sow showed it wasn t a fluke the following week when he followed that strike with another outrageous overhead effort in Fenerbah e s 5-1 win at Rizespor, sending Reddit Soccer and football Twitter into meltdown.In honour of these extravagant finishes, Fenerbah e have now released an official club shirt with Sow s name and number placed at the bottom, upside-down.The jersey has been the best selling shirt for the Turkish club since then.And, last night, Sow struck again with an overhead kick to give Fenerbahce the lead in their match against Feyernood in Holland.He has been in a rich vein of form and, at this rate, he is surely set to ask a lot of questions for the Warriors defence in Gabon.
