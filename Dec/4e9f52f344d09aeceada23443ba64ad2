DJ L-RoyArts Reporter &#8212; Club Afrique at Kopje Plaza (Net One building) will tomorrow host an all-white party to officially announce the opening of the new joint. Located at the venue that previously housed Chez Ntemba, the club opened its doors to the public a few weeks ago and tomorrow s event will mark the beginning of festivities that will add more glitters to Harare night-life. So far it has hosted a number of exciting sessions with popular DJs that include Stavo, Ash Styles and Nivek.Tomorrow s event will have the likes of DJ Storm, L-Roy, Chris, Ashley Black and Lucky the Artist on the turntables. Organisers said the official launch party will highlight the beginning of a busy festive season programme. The all-white party is here. We did not do the official launch party when we opened because we wanted to build a base of clients first. Word has gone out and people have been coming in numbers over the last few weeks. We feel it is now time to officially launch the club and invite people to an eventful festive season, said one of the organisers.Unlike many other days when patrons are charged entrance fees, tomorrow s event will be free to all, but there will be a $1 penalty for those that do not come dressed in all-white.The launch party will coincide with the introduction of Exotic Upperoom , an event that will be held at the upper section of the club and will host dancer Pinky. Pinky is known for seducing patrons with her erotic dances that have made her a permanent feature of adult entertainment in various clubs in the capital.On the bottom section, afore-mentioned DJs will present a mixed bag of music throughout the night. A number of promotions will spice up the launch party. Club Afrique will soon introduce live shows and host top artistes of various genres.
