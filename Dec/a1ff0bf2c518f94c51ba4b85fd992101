Ishamel Tsakata of Zargue&#8217;sia label during the Swahili Fashion ShowcaseTafadzwa Zimoyo Fashion Talk 263&#8212;The joy of dressing is in the art.I declare Saturdays should be runway days because for most people it is the only day to freely challenge themselves with clothes.Monday to Friday is centred on work while Sunday is for church. So this week we had fashion awards.Zimbabwe s inaugural fashion awards by Style Oracle Fashion Awards (SOFA) lived up to billing, somehow as they managed to put fashion icons, designers, models, stylists, musicians, celebrities, diplomats and media under one roof.A round of applause for the awards, although the organisers need to work on some logistics. Yes, that mentality of starting events late and setting up stage or banners while guests arrive should be stopped.The importance of fashion awards not only in Zimbabwe but globally promotes and develops the culture of art in fashion, yet alone motivating the next person.Yours Truly was awarded Best Media Personality 2016 in fashion courtesy of this column too.I won t repeat myself that when it comes to events, especially fashion bugs they now know how to dress for the occasion.Judging from the red carpet affair to the elite event, the best dressed will go to fashion blogger Lillian Madyara affectionately known as Hollywood Lee who not only showed her prowess in clothing material, suited perfectly but she managed to embrace some local designers such as Coco by Tapfumaneyi Munenga among others.Her best outfit was a yellow number which caused a stir when she walked in.She complemented it with a blue brooch, and matching shoes.One challenge we have in Zimbabwe is trying to match the international standards yet somehow we don t have the resources.However, the event was poorly attended.Founder members for the Style Oracle Fashion Awards with some of the guests of honour at the eventStill on same awards season, internationally, British Vogue took home a bespoke award at recently big Fashion Awards extravaganza entitled Special Recognition: Celebrating 100 years of British Vogue.The Marc Newson-designed trophy, which was presented to editor-in-chief Alexandra Shulman by long-time collaborator Mario Testino, was created especially for the publication to commemorate its centenary year.The evening also saw a host of other big-name winners take home their well-deserved prizes.From the Womenswear Designer of the Year, to International Model of the Year, it was all glitz and glam:Here is the list for the winners:British Emerging Talent &#8211; Molly GoddardBritish Menswear Designer &#8211; Craig Green for Craig GreenBritish Womenswear Designer &#8211; Simone Rocha for Simone RochaSpecial Recognition Award &#8211; British VogueBritish Brand Alexander McQueenInternational Business Leader &#8211; Marco Bizzarri for GucciInternational Urban Luxury Brand &#8211; VetementsNew Fashion Icons Award &#8211; Jaden and Willow SmithInternational Model &#8211; Gigi HadidInternational Accessories Designer &#8211; Alessandro Michele for GucciInternational Ready-To-Wear Designer &#8211; Demna Gvasalia for BalenciagaOutstanding Achievement &#8211; Ralph LaurenStar of the week &#8211; Zargue siaLast week he made headlines in Tanzania for the Swahili Fashion showcase and was the first Zimbabwean to exhibit at such prestigious fair.Ishmael Tsakatsa, the young man behind Zargue sia label is an inspiring youth leader with a passion for community development and education with a special focus on individuals with disabilities, using fashion.Tsakata grew up with a love for unique fashion and style.
