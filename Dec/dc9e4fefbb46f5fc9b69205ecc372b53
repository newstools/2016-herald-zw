Faith Mutema Sports Reprter&#8212;THE Zimbabwe Under-21 korfball coach Percy Samugadza is confident his team will stand their ground at the bi-annual International Korfball Federation Junior Championships here in March next year. This follows his team s good performance during the Southern Africa Tri-Nations Cup in Zambia last week.The two-day Games at the Olympic Youth Development Centre in Lusaka saw Zimbabwe coming home with a gold medal while Malawi came second ahead of the host nation Zambia. The team showed that they are working hard and fighting to stay at the top, said Samugadza. The country is proving to have a lot of talent and we are seeing all of it in players like Tatenda Mpanduki, Mitchell Masawi, Helen Chizanga, Tashan Tengwa, Michael Masikati and Mellisa Mukondya. I am very confident they are going to do it again at the Junior Championships. Since November they have been training hard and it is exciting to see their hard work paying off and this will increase their confidence. The International Korfball Federation Under-21 Junior Championships are a two-year event and it will be the first time for Zimbabwe to ever host these Games.The tourney is scheduled for March next year at Chitungwiza Aquatic Complex with countries like South Africa, Zambia, Cote d Ivoire and Ghana expected to participate.There will be 45 players in camp.
