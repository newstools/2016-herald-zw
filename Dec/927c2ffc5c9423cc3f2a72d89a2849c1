Sunday ChidzambwaGrace Chingoma and Paul Mundandi&#8212;THE ZPC Kariba leadership will next week meet to decide on coach Sunday Chidzambwa s future following the expiry of his contract. The off-season, which has already seen Chapungu coach John Nyikadzino quitting, is set to be dramatic with Moses Chunga parting ways with Harare City and a number of coaches set to leave their clubs. As of last night, championship-winning coach Lloyd Chitembwe, FC Platinum gaffer Norman Mapeza and Dutchman Elroy Akbay appear guaranteed of their jobs next season. Chidzambwa joined the club last year in June with the contract expiring on December 31. ZESA Holdings stakeholder relations executive Shepherd Mandizvidza said they will engage the coach at the appropriate time to renew his contract. The Zimbabwe Power Company Football Club had a good working relationship with head coach Sunday Chidzambwa, who served diligently to fly high the good brand of the power utility in the domain of competitive football. During his tenure, he demonstrated maturity and the football circuit of the power utility was reasonably stable throughout the 2016 Premier League season. ZPC Football Club is in a position to renew his contract and in compliance with the provisions of contractual matters, he would be constructively engaged at the appropriate time in a thrust to reach common ground with him, said Mandizvidza.ZPC Kariba did not lose a game to the top two sides FC Platinum and CAPS United this season.Meanwhile, Talent Chawapiwa became the latest player to be signed by FC Platinum on a three-year contract.Chawapiwa was the star of the show at ZPC Kariba.
