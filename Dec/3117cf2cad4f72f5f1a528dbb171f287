Crime ReporterTHE Zimbabwe Republic Police will heavily deploy during the Christmas and New Year holidays to help thwart crime. In a statement yesterday, chief police spokesperson Senior Assistant Commissioner Charity Charamba said the public should quickly report any suspicious activities to their nearest police station. We encourage the public to make use of their nearest police stations fully for the nation to enjoy a crime-free environment. We also take this opportunity to wish everyone a crime-free festive period and beyond. Let us all contribute towards a crime and accident free holiday, she said.She said cases of unlawful entry and theft normally increased during the festive season and urged the public to secure their homes and property. Snr Asst Comm Charamba said if people were going away on holiday they should leave a trusted relative at home. She said people could also advise the police so that their home would be put under the supervision scheme. The period is likely to see an increase in cases of robbery as criminals target those who carry or keep large sums of cash and other attractive items such as jewellery at home hence the public should be vigilant at all times, she said.Snr Asst Comm Charamba said the public should also be wary of robbers who waylay unsuspecting victims using secluded paths. The public should, therefore, avoid walking along secluded paths. We also urge the public to desist from boarding private vehicles as criminals are now resorting to offering the unsuspecting public transport and then later rob them of their valuables, said Snr Asst Comm Charamba.Cases of drowning tended to increase during the rainy season and police urged parents to take care of their children. The public is also discouraged from crossing flooded rivers as they risk not only crocodiles but drowning. Travelling while it is raining or hiding behind objects and trees is discouraged as they might risk being struck by lightning, Snr Asst Comm Charamba said.
