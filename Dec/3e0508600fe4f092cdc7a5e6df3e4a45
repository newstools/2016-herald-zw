LONDON. Back-to-back English Premier League soccer defeats by Liverpool and Arsenal in September forced Chelsea manager Antonio Conte to adopt the tactics that have sent his team on an 11-match winning run in the top flight. Chelsea beat Crystal Palace 1-0 on Saturday to stretch their lead at the top of the table to seven points and equalled a club record for consecutive English Premier League wins.Conte s men were beaten 2-1 at home by Liverpool in September before losing 3-0 at Arsenal, and the manager said the defeats by title rivals had prompted him to change his formation and sparked his players into life. Usually when I don t win it s very difficult to sleep, but now I m sleeping the right (amount), Conte told British media. After 11 wins, we have a positive pressure that we want to continue. I like to win, and to see my teams have two bad defeats &#8211; we deserved two bad defeats I didn t like this and I tried to find the right solution on the pitch, outside of the pitch. Reuters&nbsp;
