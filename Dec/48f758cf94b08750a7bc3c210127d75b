LONDON. Paris Saint-Germain are preparing ANOTHER move for Arsene Wenger. And this time the French soccer champions are confident they can finally land the Arsenal boss. Wenger (67) has rejected two offers from the Qatari-backed club in the last five years in order to stay loyal to Arsenal.But with his Emirates deal to expire next summer, PSG s mega-rich owners are convinced football s longest-serving boss is ready to say oui to their next approach.Wenger confirmed those previous offers when Arsenal faced PSG in their opening Champions League group game in September.He said: I have known Sheikh bin Khelaifi for a long time but I always remained loyal to Arsenal. Paris is a city I love in the country I love but I have stayed in England for all this time because Arsenal is a club that has the qualities I like. Current boss Unai Emery is already on borrowed time at the Parc des Princes just six months after replacing Laurent Blanc.Emery is under pressure in Paris with his side trailing Ligue 1 leaders Nice by seven points.A Champions League last-16 knockout to Spanish giants Barcelona could seal his fate.PSG are apparently ready to wait until next summer to secure Wenger s services.
