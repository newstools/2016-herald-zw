BEIJING. A court in eastern China yesterday sentenced the former Communist Party chief of the major city of Nanjing to 12-1/2 years in jail, after finding him guilty of corruption. Yang Weize, Nanjing s top official, was put under investigation early last year by the party s internal anti-graft watchdog.The court in Ningbo said Yang accepted bribes, either directly or through his wife, worth 16,4 million yuan ($2,38 million) between 2005 and 2014.Yang admitted his crimes, expressed repentance and cooperated in returning the dirty money, meaning he got a lighter sentence, the court added. It was not possible to reach a legal representative of Yang for comment. Chinese President Xi Jinping is leading an aggressive campaign against official corruption that is tearing down once-untouchable party, military and business leaders and rolling up their powerful networks of relatives and allies.Nanjing was China s capital city before the 1949 Communist revolution and was the scene of a massacre in 1937 by Japanese troops, an event that still plays a key role in defining China s relationship with Japan.Yang, who took on his role as Nanjing party chief in 2011, was also a member of the Standing Committee in Jiangsu province, whose capital is Nanjing.
