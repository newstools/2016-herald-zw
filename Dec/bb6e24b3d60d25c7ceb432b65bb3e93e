LONDON. &#8211; Cristiano Ronaldo s management company have defended their soccer star over allegations of tax evasion by releasing his staggering 191million income for last year. The eye-watering revelation comes after Real Madrid forward Ronaldo was accused of avoiding tax by using offshore companies in the British Virgin Islands.But the firm representing the former Manchester United favourite have published financial records showing the whopping income he declared in 2015.Gestifute, run by super agent Jorge Mendes, released Ronaldo s Model 720 tax form online, insisting Spanish tax authorities have previously been supplied the data.The document claims the 31-year-old Portugal international declared just 23.5m ( 19.8m) of income from inside Spain &#8211; where he plies his trade with Real Madrid &#8211; and made 203.7m ( 171m) elsewhere.Ronaldo s astonishing 191m he earned last year alone translates to 523 000 a day, 3.7m a week and 15.9m a month.The form, however, did not show what taxes Ronaldo paid although Gestifute insist Ronaldo has always co-operated with tax officials.The accompanying statement read: This document confirms that Spain s Tax Agency is knowledgeable of all of Cristiano Ronaldo s assets and income. From now on, the player will not make any further statement on this subject. As reported in recent days, the player has been aware of his tax obligations right away from the beginning of his professional career in all of the countries in which he has resided, and has not and has never had any issue with the tax authorities of any of those countries. - Mailonline.
