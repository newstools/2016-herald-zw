ISLAMABAD. Pakistan s embattled national carrier has been widely mocked for sacrificing a goat next to a plane to ward off bad luck, weeks after one of the country s worst air disasters. A Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) turboprop plane built by European manufacturer ATR plummeted into a mountain in a northern region on December 7, bursting into flames and killing all 47 people on board.The animal slaughter, which took place on Sunday at Islamabad airport and was captured in a photograph which went viral, was met with derision by many social media users who said the carrier was forgoing safety standards in favour of superstition. This is no joke: #Pakistan invents a new safety measure for its crashing air carrier #PIA, tweeted user Asim Yousafzai.Another user Rahoon Rashid said: (Black goats) don t keep the planes up and flying, efficiency does . Leading newspaper Dawn ran a front-page story on Monday headlined PIA: on a wing and a prayer .The sacrifice was confirmed by PIA spokesman Danyal Gilani, who said it was a gesture of gratitude by some employees before the resumption of flights of the airline s ATR fleet. It was not sanctioned by management, Gilani said.PIA grounded its 10 remaining ATR planes in the wake of the disaster pending detailed inspections.The airline s chairman Muhammad Azam Saigol last week tendered his resignation citing personal reasons .Before December 7 PIA had been crash-free for 10 years, and received a 7 out of 7 rating on the highly-cited AirlineRatings.com, which launched its annual listing in 2013.But a 2014 analysis by US statistician Nate Silver based on data from 1985-2014, found the airline to have had a consistently high number of what he termed near-misses an indicator of risk.
