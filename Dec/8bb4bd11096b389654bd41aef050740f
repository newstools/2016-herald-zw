Gambian leader Yahyah Jammeh, who vowed to rule the tiny West African nation for &#8220;a billion years&#8221;, was handed a shock election defeat on Friday 22 years after seizing power in a coup.The electoral commission head declared Adama Barrow president-elect on state television, with 45.5 percent of the vote against Jammeh&#8217;s 36.7 percent.&#8220;Having received 263, 515 votes out of the total votes cast in the election, I hereby declare Adama Barrow newly elected to serve as president of the republic of the Gambia,&#8221; Alieu Momarr Njai said. He earlier told reporters in Banjul that Jammeh would concede, although he has yet to make a public statement.Barrow also told Reuters by telephone on Friday he was expecting a phone call from Jammeh conceding defeat.Defeat and a concession from Jammeh would be momentous.Earlier this week he said that his &#8220;presidency and power are in the hands of Allah and only Allah can take it from me&#8221;, and on one occasion even said he would remain in office for &#8220;a billion years&#8221;.Voting against Jammeh was a rare show of defiance against a leader human rights groups say routinely crushes dissent by imprisoning and torturing opponents.Gambians voted on Thursday amid a total blackout of the internet and all international calls, and with land borders sealed, in a poll posing the first serious challenge to Jammeh since he seized power in a coup in 1994.He previously said he had invented a herbal cure for AIDS that only works on a Thursdays.He has also arrested hundreds of people on suspicion of being witches or wizards and threatened to slit the throats of and decapitate homosexuals.Jammeh&#8217;s supporters deny abuses and he has often criticized Western powers for meddling in African affairs.Barrow, who has for the first time united and galvanized Gambia&#8217;s opposition, has promised to revive the economy, whose sluggishness pushes thousands of Gambians to flee to Europe in search of a better life.He has also promised to end human rights abuses and to step down after three years as a boost to democracy.-Reuters(Reporting by Cheikh Sadibou Mane in Banjul; Additional reporting by Nellie Peyton in Dakar; Writing by Tim Cocks; Editing by Alison Williams)
