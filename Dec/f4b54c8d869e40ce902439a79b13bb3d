Zlatan IbrahimovicLONDON. Jose Mourinho s admiration for Manchester United s summer recruit Zlatan Ibrahimovic soared to new heights on Saturday as he cooed about the Swede s superman mentality following his latest match-winning tour de force at West Bromwich Albion. Mourinho also hailed Ibrahimovic after the veteran striker scored twice to secure Manchester United a fourth consecutive victory with a 2-0 win at West Bromwich Albion on Saturday.In the week, Mourinho had described Ibrahimovic as undroppable and he was delighted to be given another shining illustration of just why as the 35-year-old scored both goals in the 2-0 Premier League win at the Hawthorns.The United manager sang the praises of the evergreen Ibrahimovic after he struck early in each half as United moved alongside fifth-placed Tottenham on 30 points in the English Premier League soccer table.Ibrahimovic had told BT Sport before the match that he felt as sprightly as a 20-year-old and within five minutes of taking the pitch he appeared as good as his word, heading United into the lead with his ninth goal in his last nine games.In the second half, to calm fans jitters that United could let another fragile lead slip, he wriggled his way between two defenders and struck a deflected shot into the corner for his 16th goal of the season, 11 more than any of his team mates.Having taken his league total to 11 goals, he now has a strike rate in his first 16 matches for the club that has been bettered for United in the English Premier League era only by Ruud van Nistelrooy, who netted 12 in his first flush.Mourinho has been in awe of Ibrahimovic s commitment all season but, especially with his other marksmen seeming so profligate, he is happy that the Swede is reaping the rewards that reflect the quality of his performances.
