Our security team is in contact with the relevant authorities to ensure we have the appropriate level of security at the Boxing Day Test and other cricket matches being held around the country, CA chief executive James Sutherland said. The safety and security of our fans, players and officials attending any cricket match is our number one priority. Reuters
