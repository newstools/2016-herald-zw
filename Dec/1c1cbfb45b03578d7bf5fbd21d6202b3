Apostle KanjasiSophia Chese-Msowa: Arts CorrespondentDunamis Revival Ministries Apostle Stanford Kanjasi will on Friday launch his debut album The Advocate . The album carries seven tracks including the title track Gweta while other songs include Just a baby , Hakuna Munondo , and Pisarema Rakabatwa . In an interview, Apostle Kanjasi said the album, which has English, Shona and Ndebele songs, carries a message of deliverance to a struggling people. I have decided to have the album in our three main languages so that it will cater for almost everyone in Zimbabwe since my main message is of deliverance. I am saying people must be freed from evil spirits, all the negativity in life be it spiritual or economical, I am giving them a message of hope so that they may be motivated in any situation they might face, he said.Apostle Kanjasi said some of the tracks are motivated by his life experiences. The title track Gweta which I translated to English was motivated with what I once went through in my life and I thought maybe there are people who have faced similar incidences in life like being accused of something that you did not do. Some people have been arrested for crimes they did not commit so I am saying Jehovah is the only advocate who knows the truth and can stand with you in such a time according to the book of Revelations, he said.Apostle Kanjasi said he also tackles corruption in some of his songs. In this world that we are living in today, there is a cancerous disease of corruption so I also try to point out the dangers of corruption since even some church people of today are now engaging in the dangerous activity, he said.The album which was supposed to be launched at Kingstons House will be launched on Star FM platform this week.
