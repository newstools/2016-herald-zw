LONDON. Manchester United have opened talks to sign Atletico Madrid s Antoine Griezmann. It is understood United have asked a leading agent to agree a deal for the France striker (25) expected to cost in excess of 60million. He is likely to stay in Spain this season with the move scheduled for the summer. Red Devils boss Jose Mourinho has told Old Trafford chiefs that they must prioritise a No. 10 with the talent and ability to link midfield to attack.The Special One sees Griezmann as the perfect catalyst to get the best out of summer signings Paul Pogba and Zlatan Ibrahimovic.Pogba has discussed a move to England with his France team-mate.Griezmann has a contract with Atletico until 2021 but his relationship with the club and coach Diego Simeone has soured this season.After losing the Champions League final to city rivals Real twice in the last three years, Atletico look like a team which has peaked.Simeone is expected to leave for Inter Milan and Griezmann is also considering a new challenge.Atletico will not sell to Spanish rivals Barcelona or Real while Griezmann prefers a move to United which would signal the end for Wayne Rooney at Old Trafford.Portuguese outlet Record, claim United are also targeting Benfica right-back Nelson Semedo, despite already launching a 38m bid for his teammate Victor Lindelof.The 23-year-old reportedly has a buy-out clause of 54m in his contract, although United will expect to pay significantly less than that to bring him to Old Trafford.Lindelof, on the other hand, who United have opened talks with over a January move, was a target for Middlesbrough last year and nearly signed for the newly-promoted club, according to the Evening Gazette.They reveal the 22-year-old came agonisingly close to joining Boro in a cut-price deal last January, after they believed three times that they had a deal in place to bring him to the Riverside.
