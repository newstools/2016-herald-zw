LONDON. Barcelona are interested in bringing Liverpool star Philippe Coutinho to the Nou Camp, according to Ronaldinho. Coutinho has been in scintillating form for Liverpool this soccer season, scoring five goals in 13 English Premier League appearances from midfield. The 24-year-old is currently out of action with an ankle injury, and has missed the last four league matches for Jurgen Klopp s side. The German boss expects to be without his key man for the next two matches, with the crunch clash with Manchester City coming too soon for the former Inter forward.But, despite his absence, the former Brazil international Ronaldinho has revealed he has turned heads in Barcelona, and says the Spanish champions are keeping tabs on Coutinho s progress. I hope when he returns from injury that he will continue the form he has been showing all season with Liverpool, the 36-year-old told the Sun. Mailonline
