CHENNAI. Opener Lokesh Rahul hit a career-best 199 to power India s strong reply as England s bowlers struggled on day three of the fifth and final Test cricket in Chennai yesterday. India were 391 for four at stumps with Karun Nair (71) and Murali Vijay (17) at the crease. The hosts still trail by 86 runs in response to England s 477.Rahul shared a 161-run fourth-wicket partnership with Nair before missing out on what could have been his maiden double century.Rahul, who recorded his fourth Test century, was the ninth batsman in the world to get out on 199 after falling to leg-spinner Adil Rashid in the final moments of the day.The 24-year-old batsman chased Rashid s slightly wide delivery on the off-side to give away a catch to point as he crumpled into a heap with hands on head.Earlier Rahul had surpassed his previous best of 158 as he entertained a raucous Sunday crowd with a couple of reverse sweeps.He struck 16 fours and three sixes during his marathon knock, prompting England skipper Alastair Cook to rotate his bowling options.The tourists took the second new ball in the 85th over of the innings but Rahul and Nair made sure that India continued to mount the runs.Nair recorded his maiden Test fifty in just his third match to play the perfect sheet anchor role as Rahul piloted the Indian innings till his departure.England s pacemen worked hard on a batting-friendly MA Chidambaram pitch to claim two crucial wickets of Cheteshwar Pujara (16) and skipper Virat Kohli (15) in the afternoon session.It was the first time in the series that Kohli, who leads the batting chart with 655 runs, had been out for less than 40. He chipped a drive to extra cover off Stuart Broad. AFP.&nbsp;
