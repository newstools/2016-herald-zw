Blessing Malinganiza Herald Reporter&#8212;Harare City Council is set to introduce the Harare (Tuck Shops) By-Laws 2016, which are meant to regulate the operations of tuck shops that are sprouting in and around the city for them to be in line with current global trends. The by-law was promulgated following the realisation that the council was failing to get revenue from tuck shop operators yet they continued to trade even after having been served with enforcement orders. Environment Management Committee chairperson Councillor Herbert Gomba, said council wanted to formalise operations of tuck shops. We want to make sure that all operations of tuck shops are formalised and the by-law is coming in order to regulate and regularise them. Council will introduce strict enforcement to make sure revenue is collected, he said.Clr Gomba said the absence of a regulatory framework for tuck shop operations had resulted in chaos in Harare.He said the proposed by-laws would come in handy in their bid to restore sanity in Harare. In coming up with these proposed by-law, reliance was also placed on how other regional jurisdictions were handling the issue of tuck shops most notably South Africa, reads the proposed by-law.Tuck shops owners under the new by-laws will now need to obtain town planning licences before operating.
