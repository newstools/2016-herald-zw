LONDON. &#8211; Manager Arsene Wenger said yesterday that Arsenal would not sell Alexis Sanchez and Mesut Ozil even if the pair fail to agree fresh terms with the English Premier League soccer club. Wenger says the club will do the maximum of what we can to keep key forwards Sanchez and Ozil in north London.Both players are in the final 18 months of their contracts and British media report that negotiations have faltered over salary demands, with Arsenal unwilling to break its current wage structure to retain them.The reports suggested Arsenal might cash in on Sanchez or Ozil in the close season, but Wenger told a news conference the club is doing all it can to tie them down to fresh terms. These players will stay for at least 18 months, he said. We are professional people and we work until the last day of our contract with full commitment. The Frenchman did not offer assurances that the duo, who have been instrumental in Arsenal s rise to second in the table and qualification for the Champions League group stages, would be at the Emirates Stadium once their current deals end. I m not the only one who can decide that, he added. They have 18 months (left on their) contracts and are completely committed to do well as long as they are here. &#8211; Reuters.
