Collin Matiza Sports Editor&#8212;TOP Dutch motocross rider Jeffrey Meurs has fallen in love with Zimbabwe. After having visited Zimbabwe for the first time in December last year where he took part in the country s premier motorcycling event &#8211; the Zimbabwe Summer Series &#8211; the 27-year-old Rotterdam-based professional rider will be heading back here next week to grace the same competition. This year s Zimbabwe Summer Series will once again comprise of two Supercross (night racing) meetings and one full day of motocross (day racing) action on December 14, 16 and 18.The two Supercross race meetings will open the proceedings of this year s Zimbabwe Summer Series on the nights of December 14 and 16; and they will be followed by a motocross event on December 18.The Zimbabwe Summer Series will once again have an international flavour as it has attracted an array of top international riders from overseas and the Southern African region who will be led the 2010 Dutch national champion Meurs.Gary Grainger, the chairman of the Bogwheelers Club who run the motorcycling sport of motocross in this country and are the host of the Zimbabwe Summer Series, revealed yesterday that Meurs, who took part in the same event last year, will once again be coming down to this part of the world to showcase his riding skills next week at Donnybrook. I m glad to announce that top Dutch motocross rider Jeffrey Meurs, who lit up last year s Zimbabwe Summer Series at Donnybrook, is returning to this country next week to take part in the same event and he will be accompanied by his friend who will also be riding at this three-day competition. Apart from Jeffrey Meurs and his friend, we also have one English guy, Damon Strydom, plus a couple of South Africans, some Zambians and Botswana riders who all will be joined by a host of our top junior and senior bikers at this event, Grainger said.The 2015 South African 125cc High School champion Joshua Mlimi will also be returning here to compete in this year s Zimbabwe Summer Series where he will be joined by three of his country s top riders Wyatt Avis, Brad Cox and Cameron Durow.But all eyes will be on Dutchman Meurs who is just a joy to watch when mounting his machine, competing in either the 125cc, MX1 or MX2 classes.Meurs has been riding dirt bikes since he was two-years-old and has competed in several classes ever since, culminating in being crowned the 2010 Dutch national champion.He has also raced in numerous international competitions in Europe including Grand Prix 3 and some top Belgian races.At this year s Zimbabwe Summer Series, Meurs will be sharing the centre stage with a number of Zimbabwe s top junior and senior riders such as Ashley and Cameron Thixton, Brad Perry, Josh Gobey, Regan Wasmuth, Jordan Dewdney, Kude Mhene (Jnr), Big BJ Chitima (Jnr), Mudiwa Chigumba, Tristan Grainger, Ricky Whyte, Emmanuel Bako and Ryan Masimo.But the country s former champion rider Jayden Ashwell will be conspicuous by his absence as he still injured, according to Gary Grainger. It s unfortunate that Jayden Ashwell will not be competing as he is still out injured but one of our other top riders Sean Mitchell has indicated that he will be available while Regan Wasmuth is coming from South Africa to ride in this event next week, Gary Grainger said.Entry fee for this year s Zimbabwe Summer Series has been pegged at $5 per person while children under the age of 12 will get in for free.
