Clr ManyenyeniInnocent Ruwende Municipal Reporter Harare Mayor Councillor Bernard Manyenyeni has claimed that Local Government, Public Works and National Housing Minister Saviour Kasukuwere, hurriedly withdrew privileges for councillors to buy commercial or industrial stands in order to fix him. Minister Kasukuwere recently rescinded a decision by Harare City Council to sell a Newlands commercial stand to Clr Manyenyeni for $106 000.The Minister said the decision bordered on abuse of office and self-aggrandisement adding that council should dispose of land in a transparent and financially prudent manner.However, Clr Manyenyeni said the allowances, perks and privileges of councillors were provided for by a policy from the Ministry of Local Government, Public Works and National Housing not by a mayor or individual councils. This was originally under a circular done in 2011 re-enforced (at my request in 2013) when we were elected. I blocked access to this facility when we came in insisting instead that the Minister re-confirms the continued application for our new term starting after 2013 elections. Clr Manyenyeni said hurried reviews done in November had an obvious attempt to backdate it to apply specifically for him. It is 5 300sqm, the smallest of the stands being sold at that site and with the worst shape, a triangle with an un-usable peak. I did not choose it- I was shown after it was decided just like any other councillor in the country. Let it also be known that four days after my election as mayor in 2013 I filed a statement of areas of potential conflict and the letter carries the minister s signature, he said.Clr Manyenyeni said when he became associated with a real estate business, he filed a declaration with the minister for noting and early in 2015 he asked all councillors to declare all property transactions with council, be they in their names, spouses, trusts, companies, families to cover all these governance risks.He said the decision smacked of politicking and malice rather than governance.Recently, Government withdrew all privileges for councillors to purchase commercial or industrial stands citing rampant abuse of the facility by some councillors who were allocating themselves several stands and profiteering in the process.In a circular written to all urban local authorities Local Government, Public Works and National Housing permanent secretary Engineer George Mlilo, said such stands should be allocated on the basis of waiting list or by public tender.
