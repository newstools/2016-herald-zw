I was fortunate to get a platform to give my fans a Christmas offering and some of the songs I sang where very new and are soon to be released in 2017, Bryan K said. I foresee the coming year as one of the best years in my music career and I ve been preparing some songs which I have sampled at different platforms especially towards the end of the year, he said.Songs which include the popular Heavy Machine , Marunjeya and Rudo were people s favourites as many took to the dance floor when they were playing.Bryan K engaged his fans as they participated in many of his sing along tunes throughout the whole show.Some fans commended the idea of bringing live performances to the 263 Chilled ice skating rink saying that it was value for their money. This is quite a good experience especially for the Christmas holiday. We don t need to take our kids to some un-conducive environments for live shows but they get to enjoy music at the same time enjoying ice skating which is even more value for our money, said Mavis Sigauke who attended the show in the company of her three daughters.Bryan K also took the opportunity to ice skate with the kids while many of them took pictures
