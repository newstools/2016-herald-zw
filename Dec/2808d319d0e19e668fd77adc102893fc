George Chisoko Assistant Editor Government restructuring of State-owned mobile telecommunications operator, Net One has started paying dividends, a sector performance report released by Potraz last week shows. The report shows that market share of NetOne subscribers has increased in the third quarter to 36,4 percent with Econet subscriber market share slumping to 49,4 percent while Telecel now has 14,2 percent of the subscriber market share.During the same period last year when the restructuring of NetOne commenced, the Potraz report shows that it had 2,7 million active subscribers and exactly a year later it has over 4,5 million active subscribers. This means it has gained 1,8 million subscribers in one year.Telecoms experts yesterday said the strong performance has been catalysed by the sacking of under-performing and corrupt management. The Potraz report shows that NetOne has become a force to reckon in the telecoms sector. The telecoms experts further attributed the solid performance of NetOne to the revamped leadership where a new team has adopted aggressive marketing, innovation, cost containment and consumer satisfaction.Despite a loss of subscribers, Econet remained the leading mobile telecoms firm as per the Potraz sector performance report.
