Furthermore, we have opened up more service points outside the main immigration hall, he said.Mr Hamandishe said they had aligned operations with their South African counterparts with effect from December 8 to January 16.He said through the Border Post Efficiency Management Committee, they had come up with a consolidated festive season plan to ensure that traffic was cleared efficiently. Those travelling in buses will be assisted through the tagging system (cleared on first come first served basis, he said.Mr Hamandishe said they had also created an express route for motorists who wanted to access gate passes from the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority.He said travellers were being directed to the various service points as they entered the border post and that requisite directional signs were being erected. We have suspended all off and leave days for our members of staff so as to ensure that we operate at full strength throughout the festive season.
