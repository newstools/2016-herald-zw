RIO DE JANEIRO. &#8211; A footballer who survived the Colombian plane tragedy was reading a Bible passage about being safe in the shadow of your wings before the crash. The bible, belonging to Chapecoense centre back Helio Neto, was found at the scene of the crash and has been handed to the footballer s wife.His wife said Neto, who is still fighting for his life in hospital, is deeply religious and takes the religious scripture with him everywhere.A bookmark had been inserted next to Psalm 63, which talks about being safe in the shadow of God s wings and about thinking of God in bed.In detail it says: On my bed I remember you; I think of you through the watches of the night; Because you have been my help; Then I will rejoice in the shadow of your wings. My soul follows you closely; Your right hand upholds me. Video footage shows journalist Roberto Cabrini at the scene of the wreckage and noticing the book, with a note inside saying it belongs to the defender, who is in a critical condition.The reporter can be seen visibly shaking as he realises what it is.He reads with a shaky voice the name that is printed on the inside of the cover, as behind him we can see the wreckage of the crash.Mangled parts of the plane can be seen in the background and Cabrini is later seen taking the bible to the wife of Neto, who smiles as she realises what she is being given.Neto s condition has been described as delicate by doctors who said they regularly have to stabilise him as he has a serious pulmonary infection. His wife, Simone, said Neto has a lot of faith in God and takes the bible with him on all his trips. - AFP.
