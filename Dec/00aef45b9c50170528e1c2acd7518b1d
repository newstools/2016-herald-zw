The political impasse in the Gambia, an African country of less than three million people was ignited by the volte face made by its president, Yahya Jammeh who rejected the outcome of the election nine days after calling to congratulate the winner.Disturbed by the impasse and the fear of a looming crisis, the ECOWAS dedicated its ordinary session to finding solutions in the brewing political crisis in the country.According to the communiqu : The Authority considered the worrying political situation in the Gambia arising from the decision of President Yahya Jammeh to reject the results of the presidential election of December 1, 2016, which resulted in the election of Adama Barrow as the president-elect of the Gambia. The Authority enjoined the out-going President Jammeh to uphold the result of the December 1 presidential election and that he must guarantee the safety and protection of the president-elect. The Authority calls on President Yahya Jammeh to accept the result of the polls and refrain from any action likely to compromise the transition and peaceful transfer of power to the president-elect, the communiqu added.The Authority lauded the initiative that fielded a high-level mission of Heads of State comprising Presidents Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf of Liberia and Ecowas Chairperson, Buhari (Nigeria), Ernest Koroma (Sierra Leone), and Mahama (Ghana), to Banjul on December 13 to review the political situation with all the stakeholders.The Heads of State also resolved to uphold the result of the December 1, 2016 election; guarantee the safety and protection of the president-elect Mr Adama Barrow and assured that all Heads of State will attend the inauguration of the president-elect Barrow who must be sworn in on January 19, 2017 in conformity with the Gambian constitution. leadership.ng/Agencies/HR&nbsp;
