Paul Mundandi Sports Reporter BRETT Amidu is set to follow his elder brother Abbas and don the green and white jersey but not at their Premiership soccer rivals CAPS United.The young Brett, has set his sights at FC Platinum who are leaving no stone unturned in their preparations for the 2017 championship race. Brett had been strongly linked to CAPS United after he had publicly said he did not want to leave Harare but he seem to have had a change of heart as he is reported to be on his way to FC Platinum where he will play alongside one of his close friends Walter Musona. Musona and Brett are both products of the Aces Youth Academy.In the just-ended 2016 season, Brett played for Harare giants Dynamos. And when contacted by The Herald yesterday, FC Platinum s spokesperson, Chido Chizondo, indicated that the young attacking midfielder would soon put pen to paper and sign for the Zvishavane-based platinum miners. We are confident that we are going to land his signature. The player seem to be interested and as FC Platinum we are interested in his services as we feel he will add value to the team. The deal is yet to be finalised, said Chizondo.George Deda, who handles the affairs of Brett, was in the mining town last week finalising the deal.He (Deda) is currently out of the country and if Brett does not get a deal in South Africa, Sudan or Tanzania it will mean that he will be going to Zvishavane to join FC Platinum.FC Platinum have already landed Talent Chawapiwa from ZPC Kariba while defensive midfielder Winston Mhango has already committed his future to the miners and that means FC Platinum will no longer pursue the signature of Bulawayo City s Xolisani Moyo.Hwange striker Gift Mbweti is also a target for the platinum miners.FC Platinum are also looking at signing one or two Zambian strikers as they have failed to get a prolific goal getter in Zimbabwe.They, however, face stiff competition from South Africa who are always targeting the strikers from that country. They are also looking for a centre-back who will give cover to Gift Bello.FC Platinum are likely to release Tarisai Rukanda, Last Sithole and Wellington Kamudyariwa.Sithole is already on the CAPS United radar and will join the Green Machine anytime soon.
