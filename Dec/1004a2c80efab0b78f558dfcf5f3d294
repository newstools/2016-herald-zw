No CDs were available on the night and the musician surprised many by not playing songs from the album.He belted other songs from his father s albums and his previous projects. Jah Prayzah, Tryson and Allan Chimbetu who were billed to perform did not make it because the event started late and owners of the venue did not want it to exceed booked time.Seh Calaz and Douglas Chimbetu came and made brief performances. The musician s publicist Joe Nyamungoma said they could not let other musicians perform because of limited time. We had limited time at the venue and that is why they could not make it.

The same goes for other performers, he added.He said they had the new album but could not unveil it because everything at the show was being done in a hurry.
