LONDON. &#8211; It s not about the money, insisted Arsene Wenger this week. Sometimes, though, it is. Arsenal s manager was talking about Alexis Sanchez, the 27-year-old who is on 130 000 per week but wants that figure to rise north of 200 000. It makes him the 15th best-paid player in the English Premier League, way off Paul Pogba, Sergio Aguero, Eden Hazard, etc but Arsenal are reluctant to break the bank.Arsenal have been stunned by Sanchez s wage demands after the Chilean soccer star used an astonishing 400 000-per-week offer from China to try and get the club to smash their wage structure to keep him.Sportsmail can reveal the 27-year-old striker has been inundated with offers from the Chinese Super League, with clubs willing to pay him 260 000 a week after tax.Arsenal are in talks with Sanchez about extending the remaining 18 months of his contract.Arsenal know they cannot get close to the sums being offered, but Sanchez s representatives are using the Chinese cash to land a more lucrative deal with the Gunners &#8211; or elsewhere in Europe.Sanchez currently earns 130 000 a week and can expect a new deal worth about 200 000 per week before tax to make him the club s best-paid player.Whether Sanchez is prepared to spend the peak of his career away from Europe is uncertain but he is using the mega offer to drive a hard bargain.Arsenal are maintaining contact with Sanchez s representatives and remain hopeful of an agreement but they could be forced to sell him in the summer if he doesn t sign a new deal to ensure he can t leave on a free transfer at the end of next season.The Gunners are already identifying replacements with Borussia Dortmund star Marco Reus a favourite among club scouts.They were stunned when their superstar used an astonishing 400 000-a-week offer from the Chinese Super League in talks. Sanchez wanted to get the north London club to smash their wage structure for him.Over in China, clubs are willing to pay him 260 000 per week after tax.Over here, Sanchez is on 130 000, and still an extra 40 000 per week off being in the top 10 for wages in England. When a contract gets into its final 18 months, such as Sanchez s is, it is a time when the club decides whether to tie them down to a new deal.Arsenal want to &#8211; Sanchez is the Premier League s joint-top goalscorer this season &#8211; and it is now a priority to make sure he is paid on par with the other superstars.Paul Pogba is paid 290 000 per week on a contract that lasts until 2021, with a further year s option at Manchester United.Sergio Aguero is on 240 000 at Manchester City, and Yaya Toure is on 220 000. There s also Eden Hazard on 200 000 at Chelsea.You have to go past David De Gea on 185 000, Raheem Sterling on 180 000 and Cesc Fabregas on 170 000 before you get to Sanchez in 15th.Sanchez starred in Basle on Tuesday night in the Champions League and has 13 goals so far this season, his first as an orthodox centre forward.What Wenger said about wages was admirable but, for someone of such importance to Arsenal as Sanchez, it could be time to get out the chequebook. The luxury of the modern game means it should not only be about the money, Wenger said this week. Because the players, wherever they play, make good money at this level. I believe, personally &#8211; maybe I am a bit naive &#8211; that it s more about getting to meet the player s needs. The way the club has values, the way the club has ambition, the way the club respects the players. For me, that is more important nowadays and an important ingredient for every player to consider. The money is good everywhere. It s good, but it can be better, and thanks to the offers from China, Sanchez knows that.Top 20 English Premier League earners1.
