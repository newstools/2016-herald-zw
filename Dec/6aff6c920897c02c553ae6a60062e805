The special purpose vehicle that has been created for the purposes of overseeing the project development will be the Hwange Electricity Supply Company (HESCo). It shall be a joint venture company between Zimbabwe Power Company (ZPC) and Sino-Hydro Corporation, said Minister Chinamasa.He said in terms of an On-Lending Agreement, it was HESCo, that would assume responsibility for repayment of the principal loan and interest from the proceeds of electricity sales with the project set to be implemented over a period of three and half years. The cost for implementing this project is US$1.48 billion of which, US$1.147 billion is the contract price. Of the contract price, 85 percent amounting to US$997.7 million has been secured through the Preferential Buyer Credit Loan Agreement concluded with China Exim Bank. In turn, China Exim Bank has requested the contractor, Sino-Hydro Corporation, to inject US$176 million representing 15 percent of the contract price as equity into the project, said Minister Chinamasa. In addition, ZPC is required to raise US$307 million to cover the project development costs. Several efforts have been initiated to ensure that ZPC secures these resources. Insurance cover for Sino-sure is also critical for the successful implementation of the project. Expansion of the two power generation units, would provide an additional 600 megawatts of power to the national grid, said Minister Chinamasa, in addition to 920 megawatts, giving a cumulative figure of 1 520 megawatts.Minister Chinamasa said it was critical that Government approved viable tariffs to ensure competitiveness both to producer and consumer.Harare East MP Cde Terence Mukupe raised concern that the project, big as it is might deplete limestone, the consequence of which might lead to a price hike on cement.&nbsp;
