Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter&#8212;ZAMBEZI Tour director Mike Mahachi is confident they will retain all their partners for next year s Zimbabwe Open Golf Championships after their contract came to an end this year. The Zimbabwe Open is the country s flagship golf event and for the past five years was bankrolled by Delta Beverages, under their Golden Pilsener brand.After this year s event, the contract came to an end but Mahachi, whose team managed to bring back the prestigious event in 2010 after it had gone off the radar for close to a decade, remains hopeful they will finalise matters with the sponsors. So far, so good, we are discussing with our partners and I believe something positive will come up. Yes, the contract came to an end this year but we are hopeful we will come up with something. The event is scheduled for the traditional month of April and considering the progress so far, we will retain most of our partners as they are forthcoming. We are having discussions with the partners and everything is pointing in the right direction. We have managed to make a good reputation for the tournament and I think that will make the partners want to continue working with us, said Mahachi.The 2016 edition of the Zimbabwe Open had Golden Pilsener as the title sponsors while companies like sugar producer Tongaat Hullets, internet services provider ZOL and Sahwira Events Management were anchor sponsors.Last year saw Delta Beverages sponsoring the event for the fifth time.The Zimbabwe Open returned in 2010 with Africom being the title sponsors but they only managed to do so for two years as Delta Beverages took over in 2012.The company started off with a R1,6 million package which they went on to review in 2014 to R1,8 million. We always remain grateful to our partners and stay positive that we will come out with something that will see the sport develop. It is difficult in these harsh economic environment but our partners stood by us throughout so that gives us some something positive about next year s tournament set for April, added Mahachi.
