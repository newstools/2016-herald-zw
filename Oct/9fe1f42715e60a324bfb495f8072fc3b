One of the topical issues for Southern Africa at the ongoing international conference on trade in endangered species being held in South Africa is the need to lift a ban on trade in ivory. The Southern African Development Community (SADC) argues that the ban has seriously eroded the revenue for animal conservation in most countries, and led to an increase in poaching as communities no longer benefit from ivory trade proceeds.The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) an international agreement that aims to ensure that international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants does not threaten their survival imposed the ban on ivory trading to protect elephants, which were facing extinction.However, wildlife is a critical component of socio-economic development in most SADC countries, and the ban has seen an increase in ivory stock piles, which cannot be disposed, impacting on revenue and other economic sectors including tourism.Countries in the region are also contesting the ban of trade in ivory, arguing that their elephant population have grown way above the carrying capacity of their forests.For example, the elephant population in Zimbabwe the population stands at more than 100,000 which is nearly three times its sustainable carrying capacity.In other SADC countries such as Namibia and South Africa the elephant population stands at over 22 500 and about 20 000 respectively.According to CITES, southern Africa has the largest number of elephants in Africa at about 350 000 double that for East Africa, which boasts of about 166 500 elephants, mostly in the United Republic of Tanzania, which is also part of southern Africa.The bulk of the elephant population in the region is found in the Kavango Zambezi Transfrontier Conservation Area which covers parts of Angola, Botswana, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe.The rising elephant population in southern Africa has worsened cases of human-wildlife conflict, and has led to extensive environmental degradation, in the form of increased soil erosion, vegetation damage and loss of biodiversity.For example, the elephant population in Namibia is found in the northern part of the country with serious challenges of water.It is reported that thousands of elephants in Botswana continue to add pressure on wildlife habitats.The growth of elephant population in Zimbabwe has added pressure on available water resources as most of these populations are concentrated in drought prone areas forcing the Parks and Wildlife Management Authority to use borehole water as an alternative though it is very expensive to pump.South Africa is facing challenges in managing the increasing elephant population in the Kruger National Park.In light of these challenges, southern Africa is seeking approval for the sale of its ivory stock piles at the ongoing 17th Conference of Parties (COP 17) to CITES set for September 24 to October 5 in Johannesburg, South Africa.Speaking at the opening ceremony, South African President Jacob Zuma said it is critical for the global community to strike a balance between maximising the use of its resources to promote socio-economic development, while at the same time preserving them for present and future generations. It is also important for all to remember that natural resources do not only sustain livelihoods of communities. They are also critical in promoting economic development, he said. Examples of this include the lawful trade in wildlife, including the practice of hunting, which is criticised by many. The hunting sector in South Africa generates well over one billion rand a year. President Zuma also said global governance is critical for our common success . However, for this to happen it is important that we have a transparent and fair system that allows governments to meet their development imperatives which are intertwined with the sustainable use of species .At the 17th CITES, the SADC region want the conference to finalise and approve the development of a decision-making mechanism for a process of trade in ivory.Although elephant populations in the region are in Appendix II, meaning that commercial international trade in species is allowed, countries from southern Africa have for a long time not benefited much from their conservation efforts.Countries supporting the total ban of ivory are proposing the inclusion of all populations of the African elephant in Appendix I through the transfer from Appendix II to Appendix I of the populations of Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe.Appendix 1 of CITES lists species that are threatened with extinction.Trade in specimens of these species is illegal while those on Appendix II are not necessarily threatened with extinction.Southern Africa believe that a controlled marketing system is the way forward rather than a total ban of ivory trade, as ban fuels demand in the absence of a legal market.During this conference, SADC is expected to present a common position which will consolidate member states consensus on major CITES issues and address potential variations in positions between member states.A common position will further enable SADC member states to align policies and strategies for sustainable use of natural resources and the management of international trade in wild species of flora and fauna.Secretary-General of CITES John Scanlon said countries have shown a strong political will to deal with wildlife issues. Since CoP16, there has been an ever increasing level of political interest in wildlife trade issues, in particular on tackling the surge in illegal wildlife trade, and recognition of the importance of CITES both in its own right and in achieving broader goals and targets, he said.Africa is hosting CITES for the fourth time since the establishment of the governing body in 1975. However, this is the first time that the continent s hosting the meeting since 2000. sardc.net
