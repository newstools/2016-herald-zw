LONDON. &#8211; Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has refused to rule himself out of the running for the England job.Wenger admitted his priority is to stay at Arsenal and get a new contract as his current 8m-a-year deal expires this summer. When quizzed about whether he would be interested in the England job, Wenger said: I rule nothing out. My focus is here but one day why not? Wenger has been linked with the England job following the Football Association s decision to part company with Sam Allardyce on Tuesday.Allardyce s self-inflicted exit after his controversial comments to undercover reporters has left the FA searching for a new boss and they have appointed England Under-21 coach Gareth Southgate as interim manager to buy them time.Southgate will pick the team for England s remaining four matches this year and could be persuaded to remain in charge until the end of the season if there was a chance to hire a top-class boss like Wenger. &#8211; The Mirror.&nbsp;
