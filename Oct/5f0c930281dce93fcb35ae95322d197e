Liverpool. Ross Barkley s excellent goal sealed an impressive 2-0 win for Everton over West Ham in their Premier League clash yesterday ending a four-match winless run in the league. For Barkley who had been dropped both from the England squad and the Everton starting line-up this season as his form dipped &#8211; it was his first goal since the opening day of the season against Spurs. Belgian international Romelu Lukaku who set up 22-year-old Barkley for his goal had opened the scoring for the hosts with his 50th for the club. It also maintained his extraordinary record against the Hammers as it was his ninth goal in as many Premier League matches against them since he moved to Everton.Everton stay sixth, just five points off the top trio of Manchester City, Arsenal and Liverpool &#8211; West Ham stay firmly in the bottom half of the table three points above the relegation places. Everton manager Ronald Koeman said he was pleased with Barkley s performance but added he needed to be more aware on the pitch of what was required of him. It was a total team performance today, the Dutchman told Sky Sports. Ross Barkley had more impact in the last part of our attacking, not only in scoring but he was dangerous throughout. That s what the team needs. He can be very good, but it is all about knowing what you need to do. Sometimes I have to shout too much, he needs to run more. West Ham should have gone one-up in the 12th minute as a deft pass by Dimitri Payet slipped Pedro Obiang free in the box but he completely miscued his shot as it ballooned over the bar. AFP
