Minister ChinamasaZvamaida Murwira Senior ReporterThe Special Economic Zones Bill, which was referred back to Parliament by President Mugabe, sailed through yesterday with the inclusion of suggestions proposed by the Head of State and Government and Commander-in-Chief of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces, when he rejected it. The National Assembly considered proposed amendments made by President Mugabe after he expressed reservations on a clause that sought to oust the Labour Act whose effect would have exposed workers to the mercy of employers.The Bill now awaits transmission back to the President for assent.In rejecting the Bill, President Mugabe cited Section 56 of the Special Economic Zones Bill, which he said was not consistent with Section 65 of the Constitution as it sought to suspend operations of the labour laws in special economic zones.Section 56 of the Bill provides as follows: The Labour Act Chapter 28:01 and the Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Act (Chapter 14:33) shall not apply in relation to licensed investors operating in a special economic zone. Section 65 (1) of the Constitution provides that every person has the right to fair and safe labour practices and standards and to be paid a fair and reasonable wage . . .(4) Every employee is entitled to just, equitable and satisfactory conditions of work. In yesterday s deliberations, the National Assembly adopted the deletion of the term Labour Act that was in Section 56 of the Bill, thereby removing the clause that sought to suspend labour rights of workers in those zones.Finance and Economic Development Minister Patrick Chinamasa, steered the Bill yesterday.Kuwadzana East MP Mr Nelson Chamisa (MDC-T) commended President Mugabe for fighting for workers rights saying, as members of the opposition, they felt vindicated after raising the issues when the Bill was first brought to Parliament. I am so delighted that the President read in the Hansard what we said. We are so excited that wisdom has visited the Minister of Finance. We cannot suspend our own laws in certain zones simply because we want to make money. We are taking too far capitalistic tendencies, said Mr Chamisa.The Special Economic Zones Bill was referred back to Parliament in terms of Section 131 (6) (b) of the Constitution, which allows the President to express reservations on certain clauses of a Bill.Briefing Zanu-PF Members of Parliament caucus a fortnight ago, Deputy Chief Secretary to the President and Cabinet, Retired Colonel Christian Katsande, said President Mugabe referred back the Bill after receiving representations from the Tripartite Negotiating Forum comprising Government, industry and workers.The Special Economic Zones Bill is the first proposed law to be referred back to Parliament by the President during the life of the Eighth Parliament.Meanwhile, the National Competitiveness Commission Bill was tabled before the National Assembly yesterday.The Bill, which seeks to repeal and replace the National Pricing and Commission Act and provide for the establishment of the National Competitive Commission including its functions was referred to the Parliamentary Legal Committee to establish whether it was consistent with the Constitution.
