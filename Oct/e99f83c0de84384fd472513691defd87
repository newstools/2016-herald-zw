Charles ManyuchiCharles Mabika Special CorrespondentIt S now over three decades on and Zimbabwe s WBC silver welterweight champion, Charles Manyuchi has a big chance to reignite the flickering flame of a boxing wilderness that exploded into a towering inferno of a following after the late icon, Proud Kilimanjaro Chinembiri, stopped defending African Boxing Union s heavyweight king, Adamah Mensah of Ghana, with a sixth round TKO before a delirious 30 000 crowd at Rufaro on a windy night back in 1981.Never before had a boxing bout attracted such a huge turnout in the country and that night s outcome would herald a Pied Piper following for Kili and thrust the sport into a neck-and-neck local popularity contest with football.Manyuchi has a fine opportunity to achieve the same floodgates opening when he takes on Colombian artist, Jose Augustin Feria, in a non-title fight tomorrow night in the capital.Not only did Kilimanjaro , also known as The Man Mountain a self-anointed pugilist with a yearn for the knockout punch popularise the sport to dizzy heights, but he also posted some emphatic victories over world-rated opponents, who had oozed confidence after landing in the country to face him.A gigantic American fighter called Mark White Lightning Lee then ranked 10th by the International Boxing Federation (IBF) was demolished in eight rounds by the Zimbabwean champion, 12 months after he had wrestled Mensah s crown, again before a bumper crowd at Rufaro.Ugandan Big Joe Kalulu, then rated in Africa s Top 10, also tasted the wrath of the Man Mountain s fury and many more would succumb, during a glittering career that almost earned Chinembiri a world title crack at then WBC and IBF, champion Lennox Lewis.It would be folly though not to mention some of the pugilists who made this sport so glamorous and a must-see pastime whenever the likes of promoters like Paul Mangirosa Murinye (late), Stalin Mau Mau, Dave Wellings and Philip Captain Fiasco Chiyangwa brought the big boys from all over the world for matches against our local boxers.Top of that boxing array of talent was the irrepressible lightweight legend, Langton Schoolboy Tinago (undoubtedly the finest boxer ever produced in the country), Solomon Dhuri Chida (late), Mohamed Tar Baby Alfonso (late), Ringo Starr, Cranos The Dancing Master Zuma (late), Stix Macloud (late), Jiwa Margarine (late), Joseph Kid Power Mutamisi (late), Ambrose Go Man Go Mlilo, Hisman Flash Chisango, Gilbert Giro Josamu (late), Duke The Dude Chinyadza and Arigoma Master Blaster Chiponda and most recently, Zvenyika Mosquito Arifonso (not Alfonso Zvenyika, as mostly and erroneously referred to) who endeared this sport to many locals.Can The Busy Bee sting his way past Feria and lure thousands of old and new clients to his corner after tomorrow night s event?Long-time boxing follower and an admirer of the crafty skills and workmanship of former featherweight champion Zuma, Funny SB Mushava, believes Manyuchi has the guile and charisma to do it, but he warns: Don t under-estimate Feria. Mushava said: The South Americans have a good record in Africa and Manyuchi should be well on guard and not be complacent. This has to be a big night for The Busy Bee so that he can convert all doubting Thomases and prophets of doom who might want us to believe that he is a fly-by-night operator. I watched former local lightweight kings Aaron Tap Tap Ncube and middleweight supremo Ambrose Mlilo demolish two highly fancied South Americans two decades ago here, but after some tricky starts. Their secret to success is that they had prepared thoroughly for those fights. However, I also believe Manyuchi has done the same and hope that his corner will not be complacent on the night, said Mushava.Like Punish Chinembiri Kilimanjaro s elder brother and former trainer would always shout from his corner: Rova bharanzi iro Kili . . . hapana anotidhaya tiri munyika medu! (knock that pretender out Kili . . . no one is better that us Zimbabweans) that same message could be delivered to Manyuchi by his handlers who will also be eager for their fighter to rekindle the poignant and colourful following in a sport which has been forced into the shadows of other sporting disciplines in the country.
