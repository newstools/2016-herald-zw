Senior Assistant CommissionerCharity Charamba &#8211; Pic by Wilson KakuriraCrime Reporter FIVE people were murdered in separate incidents countrywide as police continue to urge the public to respect the sanctity of human life. Chief police spokesperson Senior Assistant Commissioner Charity Charamba yesterday said most of the recent murder cases were as a result of misunderstandings, fights over girlfriends and family disputes. The Zimbabwe Republic Police would like to urge members of the public to exercise restraint whenever they experience disputes with others. It is disheartening to note that despite efforts by the police and community leaders to inform and educate people on the sanctity of human life, some people do not take heed and find killing easy, she said. People have lost respect for life and to support this, five murder cases were recorded in two days, from 18-20 October 2016 in separate incidents countrywide. Snr Asst Comm Charamba said a Lower Sixth student in Lupane was axed to death as he was walking from school in the company of female school mates.She said a 30-year-old man had an altercation with a taxi driver in Beitbridge who struck him with a brick on the head. The man died on admission at a hospital. Snr Asst Comm Charamba said in Borrowdale, Harare, a 42-year-old man assaulted his girlfriend using a wooden stick following a misunderstanding over a text message.The girlfriend died later after complaining of a headache and pains from the assault. The police would like to urge people to resolve their differences amicably without resorting to violence. They should seek counselling from their local police stations, leaders and church elders. Members of the public should value the sanctity of human life and ensure that differences are solved peacefully, Snr Asst Comm Charamba said. Last week, police urged people to desist from taking the law into their hands. This came in the wake of a spate of murder cases reported in Lupane and Filabusi.
