Thupeyo Muleya recently in QUITO, Ecuador Land reform plays a critical role in the successful implementation of the New Urban Agenda blueprint that seeks to make cities habitable, resilient, safe and inclusive, the United Nations Secretary-General for Habitat III, Dr Joan Clos has said. The UN-Habitat is the United Nations programme working towards a better urban future. Its mission is to promote socially and environmentally sustainable human settlements development and the achievement of adequate shelter for all.Dr Clos made the remarks while addressing journalists at the just-ended third United Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development, Habitat III held in Quito, Ecuador. He said land was a very important component for the growth of towns and cities and hence the need to carry out land reform in some instances. In many parts of the world, good organisation cannot go without land reform. It is important that we improve the access to land and quality of life for our citizens. It s a reality that if we want to have good organised towns and cities, we conduct land reform. Central and local governments need to work together for the success of the new urban agenda, he said. Zimbabwe has already embarked on a successful land reform programme to socially and economically empower its people.
