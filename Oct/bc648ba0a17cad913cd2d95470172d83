LONDON. Chelsea have confirmed they have signed a new kit deal with Nike, believed to be worth an estimated 60m a season for the next 15 years. The Londoners have been in negotiations with the American sportswear giants since confirming they would be ending their current agreement with Adidas six years early back in May.Chelsea had to pay around 40m to part company with the German firm but that will easily be covered by the new deal, which is due to come into effect next season.The club described the signing of the new technical partnership as the largest commercial deal in the club s history , with Nike producing kits for the first team, academy and ladies teams throughout the long-term agreement , which is understood to last until 2032. At around 60m a season, that means Chelsea will receive 900m from Nike over the next 15 years. Guardian.
