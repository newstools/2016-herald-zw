The outing was good for all of us as we learnt something and we will try and implement the things, said Matore.Nash Head in charge of soccer, Albert Macheka, thanked the sponsors. We learnt a lot from the trip and we thank the sponsors. Coca-Cola have remained our only sponsors and we are grateful and wish to maintain the relationship.
