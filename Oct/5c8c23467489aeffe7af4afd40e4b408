LONDON. Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola is refusing to play Yaya Toure in an effort to exact revenge on the player, according to agent Dimitri Seluk. The midfielder s representative thinks that the Catalan is annoyed with him after he criticised the coach for selling Toure while at Barcelona. Guardiola is currently refusing to play the Ivorian until he receives an apology from Seluk for comments made about the coach this season. The City boss has vowed not to select Toure until his adviser, Seluk, apologises for an interview he gave The Mirror Sport after the Ivory Coast international was left out of the Blues Champions League squad in September.Seluk insists that he has attempted to contact Guardiola on several occasions &#8211; only to be blanked. And he believes that the Catalan has now made it his mission to humiliate a player who should be remembered as a legend at the Etihad.Seluk says he tried to arrange a meeting with Guardiola ahead of City s game in Barcelona two weeks ago &#8211; and was met with a wall of silence. And he claims it wasn t the first time that the City boss &#8211; and director of football Txiki Begiristain &#8211; have ignored his pleas to broker a compromise. The Mirror.
