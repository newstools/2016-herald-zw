LONDON. Ryan Giggs has shed some light on his brief stint as Manchester United boss. Giggs was put in temporary charge of the Red Devils after David Moyes was sacked following his failure to secure European football in 2014. The former Wales international took charge for four games, beating Norwich and Hull but dropping points against Sunderland and Southampton.And Giggs, who left United this summer after a two-year stint as assistant manager, revealed he found it hard overlooking his bond with the United players. It was difficult for me because I was still a player then, so I was having to drop teammates . . . or not pick teammates, he told ITV Sport.Despite problems in the caretaker role, Giggs thinks new England boss Gareth Southgate will find making the tough decisions far easier. Southgate is filling in while the FA look for a permanent successor to Sam Allardyce, who controversially left the role last month. Gareth s had the experience with the Under-21s, so he s already been a manager of a country, Giggs added. He s not going from club to country; I think he s had a good transition I think he s ready.
