Elita Chikwati Agriculture Reporter&#8212; Farmers in Chipendeke, Manicaland Province, are reportedly buying cattle at low prices from Mozambique for resale at high prices in Mutare and surrounding areas, it has been learnt. Cattle are cheaper in Mozambique, selling between $100 and $150 per beast while in Mutare, healthy beasts are going for at least $350. Some of the farmers are buying the cattle for rearing.The farmers said they did not require transport to move the cattle as Mutare was near the Mozambican border. Others said there were no defined restrictive structures making it easy for them to bring in cattle from the neighbouring country.Chipendeke farmer Mr Joseph Mushape said it was not difficult to buy cattle from Mozambique and move them, as was the case with Zimbabwe. A farmer can sell a beast here and use the proceeds to buy three beasts in Mozambique. Most people buy the cattle and bring them in and then apply for a permit to move them to their farms, he said.Agriculture, Mechanisation and Irrigation Development Deputy Minister Paddy Zhanda said he was not aware of the practice but said it was dangerous to the livestock industry as it increased chances of spreading zoonitic diseases. We do not import cattle because they are cheaper, but because of the genetic properties and requirements. It is illegal to bring in cattle without proper documents and following proper channels. There are dangers the farmers may bring cattle with diseases, he said.Deputy Minister Zhanda said under normal circumstances, the ministry sends people to inspect the source of the cattle to check if the animals meet the country s requirements before importation, to reduce chances of importing cattle with diseases. It is illegal to smuggle in cattle and people will be prosecuted. The imported cattle may also be destroyed, he said. It still needs to be established whether the farmers are not buying from cattle rustlers.
