Collin Matiza Sports EditorTWO of Zimbabwe s top junior motocross riders Daiyaan Manuel and Jordan Dewdney made their presence felt during the final round of the 2016 South African National Championship series at Terra Topia in Johannesburg where they both grabbed places on the podium in the different classes that they competed in last weekend.First on the track at Terra Topia on Saturday was Dewdney, who this year competed in the 50cc Class during the tough seven-round South African Nationals, and he wagged his tail vigorously to finish in a credible third place behind Jordan Van Wyk and Seth Young, both from South Africa.Young Dewdney s outstanding performance last Saturday was good enough to land him a top three finish in the overall standings of the 50cc Class in the 2016 South African National Championship Series.Last Saturday, Dewdney took second place in the first heat and then third place in the second to finish third overall for the day.He also finished third overall in this year s South African National Championship series, 24 points behind Van Wyk and Niel van der Vyver.And that s a phenomenal achievement for the Lilfordia Primary School pupil who recently celebrated his ninth birthday.When contacted yesterday, Dewdney said he was very happy with his (overall) result for the season and thanked his sponsors Trek Petroleum, Fuchs Silcolene, Runiville Parts, Firewerx Motox team, Domboshawa A Team and Taydan Sewing for all the support they gave him this year.Not to be outdone by Dewdney last Saturday at Terra Topia was another top junior Zimbabwean motocross rider Manuel who also came third overall in the 65cc Class.Manuel (11), a Grade Six pupil at St. John s Preparatory School in Harare who was the 50cc Class champion in South Africa in 2014 before he moved to the 65cc Class, went into Saturday s final race meeting of the 2016 season separated by 24 points with the frontrunner in this section, which was hard for him to make up in one event and be crowned this year s champion.Nevertheless, Manuel rolled his sleeves on Saturday and took care of business, finishing third overall in the 65cc Class behind his two South African rivals Hayden Tully, who came first, and second-placed Dylan Kirk.And Manuel thanked his local sponsors Motul (Zimbabwe), Tandamanzi and Thor for the unwavering support that they gave him during this season.Another promising young Zimbabwean rider Regan Wasmuth also competed in the 125 High School section during this year s South African Nationals but failed to get a place on the podium in all the races that he competed in during the tough seven-round series.Last Saturday, Wasmuth finished 13th overall and seventh for the season in the 125 High School Class.In heat one, Wasmuth didn t get a good start at all.He was lucky enough to slot in the inside after a minor first turn pile up and came out the first corner in third place; and stayed that way for three laps until his bike seized.He heat two, Wasmuth managed to get another bike for the second race. Once again he didn t get the start he needed but snuck up on the inside of the first corner and came out in around fifth or sixth place.Wasmuth made the passes he needed to and eventually he was sitting in fourth place, closing in on the rider in third position.He could feel that he was getting closer and just as he started charging even harder to catch up the leaders, he cross-rutted going into a really fast corner.It then took him a while to get up and regroup but he just felt so much pain on his right hip so he just circulated.
