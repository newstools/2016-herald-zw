Bipin Dani in MUMBAI, IndiaTHE Umpire Decision Review System will not be used in the Test series between Zimbabwe and Sri Lanka which gets underway in Harare tomorrow. According to the highly-placed sources in Sri Lanka Cricket, no efforts were made to convince the host country to use the system for the two Test series. The host board (Zimbabwe Cricket in this case) bears the total cost of the system to be in place and it has been decided mutually to avoid its use , the source, speaking exclusively from Harare, confirmed yesterday. Australia s Simon Fry and England s Ian Gould are scheduled to officiate as field umpires with Jeremiah Matibiri (first Test), Langton Rusere (second Test) and Russell Tiffin as local TV/Reserve umpires. England s Chris Broad will be the ICC match referee. Sri Lanka Cricket have not sent any selector for Tests to Zimbabwe. This was confirmed by the president Thilanga Sumathipala.The chief selector Sanath Jayasuriya has been travelling to Australia with the 1996 World Cup winning team to Australia and it is not certain whether he would be available for the ODIs. Meanwhile, Zimbabwe selectors chief Tatenda Taibu doesn t have a problem with having a bowler as skipper. Having a bowler as a captain is not disadvantageous , Taibu believes. It s just more of the individuals understanding of the game which I believe he does . You will see a new Zimbabwe team from here on. We have helped in sorting out the contract issues and basics that will allow the players to be free to just play . I believe the players are starting to see and buy into the vision we are bringing in and ultimately the players will benefit. Just watch these Test matches and note the difference.
