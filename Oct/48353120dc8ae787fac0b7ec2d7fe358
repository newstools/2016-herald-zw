Zimbabwe generates an average of 1 000MW against peak of demand of 1 400MWBusiness ReporterThe Zimbabwe Power Company missed its output target during the third quarter of 2016 by 9 percent largely due to cash flow challenges and forced outages at Hwange Power Station, the country s largest power plant. ZPC, the power generating subsidiary of Zesa Holdings produced 1 758,24GWh against a target of 1 935,10GWh, managing director Mr Noah Gwariro said.ZPC also experienced delayed return to service of Turbo-Alternator Number 1 at Harare Power Station, which was anticipated to be back in service by April 2016.Mr Gwariro said the rotor was finally delivered a month ago and installation works were in progress. He added that low availability of the boiler plant at the small thermals resulting in intermittent operations as well as erratic coal supplies due to inconsistent deliveries also contributed to the 9,14 percent negative variance.Despite missing the target, power supplies have remained stable.Zimbabwe generates an average of 1 000MW against peak of demand of 1 400MW and imports up to 300MW.On the ongoing expansion projects, Mr Gwariro said the Kariba South Extension is now 58 percent complete and within the schedule, hence we are on target to commission the first unit on December 24 2017 .He said Sino Hydro representatives were in the country from June 15 2016 to July 8 to work on finalising all agreements required for financial closure for the Hwange expansion project.Negotiations between ZPC and the Zimbabwe National Water Authority for a water supply agreement for the Harare II re-powering project were completed. The agreement is expected to be signed upon confirmation of water charges.The expression of interest to pre-qualify Indian bidders for the Bulawayo re-powering project was in progress, Mr Gwariro said and the short-listed bidders will be sent to ZPC for issuance of relevant documentation once the pre-qualification exercise is completed.
