Takudzwa Matambura Herald Reporter DEVELOPMENT partners have taken over the procurement of medicines for public hospitals amid revelations that they are funding 98 percent of drugs used there. The country is experiencing economic challenges that have made it difficult for Treasury to fully fund public hospitals. Speaking at an all stakeholders meeting at NatPharm in Harare last week, Principal Director-Preventive Services in the Ministry of Health and Child Care Dr Gibson Mhlanga said Government remained committed to funding the health sector. As Government we know that development partners are contributing about 98 percent of our available medicines in all our public health institutions. To the development partners, here present, I wish to state that the Government appreciates your assistance. We thank you very much for that, he said.Dr Mhlanga said the provision of healthcare remained a top priority for Government. He said healthcare was critical for sustained economic development and growth. This, you will agree with me, that healthcare and especially the supply of medicines is high on the Government agenda. While there are resource constraints, the will and commitment is there. Because of the challenges we have raised as your ministry, Government has responded favourably by allocating funds, though not adequate, to the Ministry and Zim-Assett has listed Health as one of the must do quick wins within the social service and poverty reduction cluster, said Dr Mhlanga.
