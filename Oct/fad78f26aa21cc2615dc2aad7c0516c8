Fidelis Munyoro Chief Court ReporterThe Judicial Service Commission deliberated on the case of High Court judge Justice Priscilla Chigumba, who is accused of soliciting for a $20 000 bribe from a litigant, during a meeting held this week, but declined to make public the deliberations. JSC secretary Justice Rita Makarau confirmed the meeting was held on Thursday, but would not give the details.She said she was not authorised to comment on the matter. No comment, said Justice Makarau, who had earlier on said she needed authority from the JSC chairman Chief Justice Godfrey Chidyausiku.Two weeks ago, Justice Makarau told The Herald that JSC was seized with the matter and that it would discuss it at the meeting, which took place on Thursday this week.It emerged during the interview last month that Justice Chigumba attempted a bribe-harvest of $20 000 from one of the parties in a case she was presiding over.Justice Chigumba was grilled by members of the JSC led the Chief Justice over a complaint that it received to the effect that the judge had sent an agent to solicit for a bribe from Mr John Kanokanga who was one of the parties in a case in which she was presiding over.Justice Chidyausiku said the JSC had received a written complaint from Mr Kanokanga and said while they had asked Justice Chigumba to make a written response, she was obliged to comment on the allegations since the commission was troubled over the allegations given that she was seeking higher office.Justice Chigumba strenuously refuted the allegations and challenged the complainant to produce evidence instead of mere hearsay. I want to place it on record that I deny these allegations. I want to deny that I, myself, or through an agent solicited, a bribe from Mr Kanokanga, said Justice Chigumba. I would like Kanokanga to avail evidence against me because an allegation, which is baseless and without foundation should not be allowed to influence processes.
