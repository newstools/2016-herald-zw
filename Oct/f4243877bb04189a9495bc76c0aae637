Temba MliswaTichaona Zindoga Political Editor In a piece titled It s Norton or nothing for Zanu-PF published in this paper last week, I reflected on the high stakes that characterised the by-election in the town. With days to go, the situation on the ground appeared to suggest that Zanu-PF would face an upset and this would have a strong bearing on national politics and discourse. There were ominous signs for the ruling party and, as we pointed out, Mliswa was darkly confident and was buoyed by support of the opposition, mainly the MDC-T, which threw its weight behind him.On the other hand, the controversial and outspoken politician appeared to dwarf his less seasoned and less charismatic opposite number.It would also not help the ruling party s cause that the Norton constituency was predominantly an urban area with just a couple of rural and farming wards and that Mliswa had once been chairman of the province and commanded structures that previously were in the hands of Zanu-PF or recently disaffected members of the ruling party. For the ruling party it may be Norton or nothing, especially with the dynamics happening within and outside the party, the piece averred. Concluding: It is not a secret that a victory for Mliswa will send all manner of messages . . . This time stakes are even higher. Well, it has just happened.Mliswa walloped Chindedza in the by election held on Saturday by 8 927 to 6 129, a margin of over 2 000 votes especially in a by-election scenario.And as we speak, talk has just been swirling over the result in the main political spectrum.On one hand is the opposition that is revelling in the victory, much vicariously so for the MDC-T who have been boycotting by-elections ostensibly over electoral reforms.It is ironic, though, that the same opposition that has issued a fatwa on elections is seen supporting a candidate and celebrate a victory in the same elections.On the other hand, Zanu-PF is licking its wounds and this has further exposed a curious side of the fratricidal politics that is characterising the ruling party.Contending factions are blaming each other for the result.Some members are even celebrating the loss because they think that it will work against certain individuals and interests.It becomes interesting.However, there are many lessons to be learnt, and observations to be made from Saturday.The first observation is that democracy is alive and well in Zimbabwe as an independent candidate bagged a seat against a mighty party called Zanu-PF.The best men winIt also tells us just how facile and unnecessary is the noise about the so-called electoral reforms for which the opposition has been boycotting polls since 2013.While anything that improves the experience and praxis of democracy is welcome, including neatening electoral processes, the noise that the opposition has been making is unnecessary and suggestive of people with cold feet especially after 2013.Mliswa did not have cold feet he bulldozed his way, as his moniker suggests.At the MDC-T 17th anniversary celebrations in Bulawayo a few weeks ago, he openly contradicted the party and said he was going to contest albeit asking for opposition support.And just recently, he confided in this writer that there were no rigging of elections because of the tight system.He can vouch for that statement.For Zanu-PF, Norton is fraught with lessons to be learnt.Zanu-PF is a house divided.It s not even rocket science and the said celebrations by some individuals over the loss by the party are telling.In a pathetically parochial sense some quarters think that the loss spites the political commissar, Saviour Kasukuwere.There were even reports of people withholding support for the party and poor Chindedza because they wanted the result that came on Saturday.It must be such a burning shame for Zanu-PF.It has just sent a message to the opposition that it can be defeated and those ideas about grand coalitions to dislodge Zanu-PF have been given fresh impetus.That was always going to come from Norton as a dry run for consociational opposition politics currently under the aegis of National Electoral Reforms Agenda (nera).We await the next by-election.In terms of messaging and winning the battle of minds and hearts, Zanu-PF simply came short.The one key message was about residential stands that were promised young people and at the last count close to 10 000 pieces were set to be dished out. There is no doubt that residential stands are a public good.More people now, than ever, are dreaming of owning their own houses and the offer for land is irresistible. It is also irresistible for opposition supporters, too. Hence, whoever is endowed with hands can grab their piece of cake, but retain votes for their candidate of preference.It is a classic survival story.This means that Zanu-PF will have to be more creative not only with resources at its disposal, but also with a holistic message that appeals to the people. And throwing away goodies like confetti on the eve of an election is not the most creative or enduring of strategies. Connected to the issue of messaging, Zanu-PF will better learn to gauge popular sentiment and act accordingly.Many Zimbabweans are sufficiently unhappy about issues such as corruption and the widening gap between the rich and the many poor of us.The growing and filthiness of riches of certain individuals in the ruling party is building resentment towards the party and when action is not taken, the party is sure to be at the receiving end of many Nortons.It does not help either when the electorate is told that nothing will happen to those with sticky fingers and much time and energy is devoted to defending the vice all in a short campaign period of an election whose stakes are self-evidently high.Crucially, Mliswa saw the boon and had a meal out of condemning corruption and failure to arrest it. A man or woman with an empty stomach is not too hard to work up especially when some fat cats are pointed out as reasons for his want.In simple terms, the ruling party will do well to tackle corruption and send a good vibe out there as bad guys are thrown behind bars where they belong. Lastly, zanu-PF will do well not to create more than it already has. The traditional opposition is enough and enemies within are more dangerous than those without.
