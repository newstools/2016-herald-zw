MONTEVIDEO. Brazil and Uruguay scored easy victories to maintain their lead at the top of South America s 2018 World Cup soccer qualifying tournament as Chile lost ground after crashing to defeat in Ecuador. A virtuoso performance from Barcelona superstar Neymar lay at the heart of Brazil s 5-0 mauling of Bolivia in Natal, with the striker launching the rout with his 49th international goal.Neymar set up two more as Brazil produced their most stylish performance of recent memory to rattle in further goals from Gabriel Jesus, Filipe Luis and Liverpool duo Philippe Coutinho and Roberto Firmino.Brazil coach Tite, who has now won all three games since taking over from sacked predecessor Dunga, said he had not expected his team to win so impressively. I did not expect this, Tite said. The team is working very hard for each other. We are trying to play the players in the positions that they play for their clubs. I believe that is helping. AFP.
