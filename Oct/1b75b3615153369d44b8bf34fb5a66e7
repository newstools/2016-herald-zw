LONDON. Liverpool will be looking to end a dismal English Premier League run against Manchester United and build on a promising start to the campaign with victory over their bitter north west rivals on Monday night. Resurgent Liverpool are three points ahead of United in the table as Jose Mourinho s rebuilding programme stutters, but their current run of four successive league defeats to the Old Trafford club is their worst against them for eight years.Liverpool, who knocked United out of the Europa League last season, have not beaten them in domestic competition since March 2014, but they meet for the first time in this campaign with Juergen Klopp s men in supreme form.They have won their last four English Premier League matches and suffered only one defeat in all competitions so far.
