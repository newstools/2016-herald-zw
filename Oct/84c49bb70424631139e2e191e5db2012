AMSTERDAM. A searing first-half strike from Paul Pogba handed France a 1-0 win at rivals the Netherlands as Belgium and Portugal clocked up 6-0 victories and Christian Benteke grabbed a slice of World Cup soccer qualifying history. Criticised by coach Didier Deschamps for his performance in Friday s 4-1 win over Bulgaria in Paris, the world s most expensive footballer emphatically replied with a towering display for Les Bleus in Amsterdam in the most eye-catching fixture on Monday night.The Manchester United midfielder s powerful hit from 25 metres out after half an hour left diving Dutch goalkeeper Maarten Stekelenburg able to get his hands to the fizzing ball but unable to stop it. I didn t speak to him (Pogba), I just said a few words to him before entering the changing rooms, I have confidence in you, said Deschamps. The match confirms what he is able to do. Pogba was much better in everything he did. He showed what he can do. We never doubted he could do it. We mustn t forget Paul is relatively young and he can still progress. France, losing finalists on home soil at Euro 2016, are equal on seven points at the top of Group A with Sweden, who beat Bulgaria 3-0 at home in Solna. The two countries will play on November 11 at the Stade de France. AFP.
