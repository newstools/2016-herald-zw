Toya DeLazyNaledi Sande Arts ReporterSouth African singer Toya DeLazy s concert that takes place this Friday has been moved from Borrowdale Racecourse to Harare International Conference Centre. Everything else about the concert remains unchanged.The change has been necessitated by a tiff between the owners of the initial venue and nearby residents.A statement released by Minky Walters of Sound Event Management that are running the show noted the changes. We have been informed that the Mashonaland Turf Club is no longer able to allow Borrowdale Racecourse to be used to host open-air musical concerts, after complaints by nearby residents were upheld by the courts, says the statement.This has also affected another concert that Sound Event Management was hosting at the Borrowdale racecourse scheduled for October 22, Summer Night Concert, which has been postponed to November 12 with a new venue to be announced later.Minky added, While we are disappointed and sincerely regret any inconvenience to the public, we are aware that patrons will understand the need for these changes and will understand that this is caused by a situation totally beyond our control. On the positive side, the pricing for the advance tickets has been reduced to $5 and $10 for upper level and balcony area of HICC and $15 and $20 for the Gold Circle and VIP area.Advance tickets can be purchased at webtickets.co.zw and at Sound Event Management s Box office and gate prices will be going for $10, $15 and $20 for upper level, balcony and gold circle respectively.Local acts at the concert will come from Tammy, Alka Nemo, Dice, ProBeatz, Simba Tagz, Ammara Brown and Tytan.
