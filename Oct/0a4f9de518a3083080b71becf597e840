Paul Mundandi in ZVISHAVANE FC Platinum are looking to exorcise the ghosts at Ascot where they are yet to score since 2014 when they clash against Chapungu this afternoon. Assistant coach Patrick Mandizha yesterday said they will be in the hunt for maximum points. We are in the championship race and all we need to do is to collect maximum points tomorrow (today) against Chapungu. It is going to be a tough match as Chapungu are fighting for survival and also would love to finish on a higher note. We want to keep our aspirations high and we are very much still in the running for the title. I am appealing to our fans to rally behind the team and accept whatever results because in football you win some, draw some and lose some, said Mandizha.FC Platinum will miss the services of Charles Sibanda and Winston Mhango who are both recovering at home following a car accident which claimed the life of one FC Platinum fan Wellington Chiyangwa.Sibanda lost two of his teeth with Mhango suffering an injury on the leg. Gerald Takwara will still be serving suspension after he was shown a red card during the league match against Harare City at Rufaro. Chapungu coach said they enjoy good relations with the miners. FC Platinum are our brothers. We have Cleopas (Kapupurika) who was loaned to us by Platinum which shows that we are brothers .We want a positive result. If they are going to be champions they have to show character tomorrow but we are going to give them a good run for their money and the better team of the day will win but we have prepared well for them. he said.
