Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports ReporterWARRIORS coach Calisto Pasuwa will be one of the high-profile coaches expected to grace the annual Nyanga East Super Foundation sports tournament finals at Nyanga Country Club this Sunday. The gaffer confirmed he will be part of the tournament which got underway last year and now in its second year.It is the brainchild of Information, Communication and Technology and Courier Services Minister, Supa Mandiwanzira, who is also the Nyanga South House of Assembly Member of Parliament.This year the event has grown from ward level to constitutional level with youths competing in soccer, netball, darts and volleyball.Last year Nyasaru from Tangwena ward 21 won the soccer tournament at Regina Mundi.Tournament co-ordinator, Richard Mandiwanzira, said they were expecting a bigger and better tournament. Our aim is to scout for talent in the grassroots where we believe there is not much exposure. The event began last year at a small scale but we have since improved it to constituency level. We have decided to engage youths through sports and we hope it will go a long way as we would like to invite some scouts to come and watch the finals. There will be some former players like Alois Bunjira and Stewart Murisa who will also grace the occasion, said Mandiwanzira.TeamsSoccer: Mangondoza ward 31, Nyamhuka ward 29, Nyatate ward 17, Regina / Samanyika ward 13.Netball: Soccer ward 31, Mangondoza/ AABS ward 29, Nyamhuka/ 0 stars ward 17, Nyatate ward 13, Samanyika / ReginaDarts: Gonde Ward 22, Nyarumvurwe Ward 23, Nyamhuka Ward 29, Mangondoza Ward 31.
