GonyetiArts CorrespondentAs she continues with live shows since quitting Jah Prayzah s Third Generation band, Pamela Gonyeti Zulu will tonight perform at La Rouge in Westgate. The venue becomes her new weekly-show joint following other slots at Jazz 24 /7 and Time and Jazz Caf . In an interview, the gifted choreographer, who is due to launch her debut album titled One Day before year end, said: I have always loved taking risks in my career and music like any other profession is all about taking risks. I relocated from Victoria Falls to Harare to enhance my career and I think I am simply doing what I love most. I have just clinched a deal with management at La Rouge in Westgate where I will be playing on Fridays starting tonight and I just feel humbled with the honour. I have been to the venue as a patron before and I am glad I will be returning there as an entertainer. This honour has come at a time when the festive season is just by the corner and I hope to impress and command this slot. Currently, I have a number of midweek slots and this one which falls on a Friday is a bit special since I have been afforded a chance to usher merry-makers into a brand new weekend on song and dance, said Gonyeti.She is not new in the game having fronted a number of jazz outfits in Victoria Falls before she relocated to the capital. When she relocated to the capital, she would alternate between Summer Breeze and Jabavu Drive prior to her joining Jah Prayzah in 2013.She, however, left Jah Prayzah on the eve of the seventh album, to pursue a solo career.
