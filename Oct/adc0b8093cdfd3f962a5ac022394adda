Tawanda Marwizi Arts CorrespondentAfter taking a two year break Jazz songstress Prudence Katomeni-Mbofana has bounced on the limelight. The BP Yangu Yakwira hit maker announced her comeback with a performance at Theatre in Park. During her break, she was taking care of her baby as well as pursuing her studies. I have a baby I was looking after and it was difficult for me to balance many demanding roles so it was not proper for me to have live performances as well as releasing songs, she said. Everything is now in place and she is ready to carry on with her work. I am working on an album that will be released sometime next year. We are still debating with the management if we can unveil two singles before its release, she added. Katomeni vowed not to play the songs on her live shows. I will not play the songs at live shows because of piracy. We work hard to please our fans but for now we are working on our stage work, she said. She will only play new songs after the release of her new singles. We work on our stage work so that we give our fans best acts. If we play the songs they end up being pirated, she added. Katomeni is a Jazz musician who rose to prominence with songs BP and Ruva Rangu winning hearts with her soulful voice. She has featured on several movies that include More Time and Playing Warriors . Acting is in me and I have been balancing the two genres. My album will also give people reflection of my career, she said. She is optimistic that people will love her stage work as well as the new singles. I am working hard and I hope people will accept my works. Jazz is growing and from my experience the genre will do well, she added.
