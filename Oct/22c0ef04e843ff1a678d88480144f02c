SHANGHAI. A grim-faced Rafael Nadal crashed out of the Shanghai Masters tennis tournament yesterday as Nick Kyrgios departed to boos after perhaps the most spectacular meltdown of his volatile career. Nadal lost 6-3, 7-6 (7/3) in the second round to Viktor Troicki, his first ever defeat to the Serb and just the latest setback for the fading Spanish great.Chinese fans brandished pictures of Nadal including one of him in his underwear but some were left in tears as the 14-time Grand Slam champion was well beaten.Afterwards Nadal, now 30 and with a catalogue of injuries to his name, vowed to return to top form by next season, mainly by putting the zip back in his forehand and movement. I know what I have to do and I m going to do it, scowled Nadal, who has dropped to fifth in the world after a misfiring season. I ve got two-and-a-half months until next season starts so I have got two-and-a-half months to put myself at the level I want to be. And I m confident I m going to do it. AFP.
