Partson ChimbodzaArts Correspondent Promoters across the country have rallied behind award-winning promoter Patson Chimbodza ahead of his birthday celebrations to be held at Andy Miller Hall next month. Jive Zimbabwe, an organisation that has been tasked to organise the gig, said they have done everything to prepare for the celebrations. Director Benjamin Nyandoro said most promoters, musicians and organisations had come on board to celebrate with the popular promoter. All is set and since we started publishing the advert, several musicians are coming on board. People just said we want to host something for the promoter who has worked hard in developing our music industry, he said.He said as Jive Zimbabwe they were happy to be given such a task.Several musicians that include Oliver Mtukudzi, Alick Macheso, Jah Prayzah, Andy Muridzo, Ammara Brown, Freeman, Soul Jah Love and Sandra Ndebele have shown interest in the gig. Nyandoro said all the artistes have shown their commitment in participating in the high-profile gig. We have more coming now and since it is a birthday celebration all the artistes coming on board are welcome. We want to celebrate it in a big way, he said. Award-winning promoter Daniel Masaiti who is current Nama Promoter of the Year said they were behind Chipaz. We worked well with him and we have been having joint shows in Marondera. We are happy that musicians have come on board to celebrate the big day for the promoter, he said. Chipaz said as he celebrates his birthday he has realised the loopholes promoters have. We tried to form a promoters union but it all failed because we are not united. Yes, it s my birthday but we need to come together as promoters having events that uplift Zim showbiz, he said. He said in the line-up there is a mixture of dancehall and sungura. I am one of the promoters who managed to stand with dancehall. There was need for grooming among the majority of the young stars and I think I did my best, he said.
