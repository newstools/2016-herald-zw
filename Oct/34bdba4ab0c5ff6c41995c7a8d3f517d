The Environmental Management Agency (EMA), Zimbabwe United Nations Association (ZUNA), Zimbabwe National Water Authority (ZINWA), Lake Chivero users and various schools were part of the clean-up which was organised by ZUNA on Saturday and yesterday.Addressing stakeholders at the clean-up yesterday, the Acting Minister of Environment, Water and Climate Cde Sithembiso Nyoni, said the clean-up of Lake Chivero was prompted by the accumulation of solid waste generated from activities around the lake. Waste management has become one of the major environmental challenges faced by the country with thousands of tonnes of solid waste being generated daily in the country. The clean-up held over the past two days at Lake Chivero is an important milestone towards the realisation of a clean, safe and healthy environment, she said.Minister Nyoni added that fines for littering went up to level three which amounts to $20 while the fine for illegal dumping of litter went up to level fourteen which translates to $5 000.She further urged businesses especially, fishing cooperatives at the lake, to adopt sustainable waste management practices and avoid the generation of litter in the lake and its shores.Tonnes of waste material which include weeds and numerous fishing nets caught by weeds and neglected in the water were removed.Sport and Recreation Minister Makhosini Hlongwane said Government was in full support of activities aimed at the resuscitation of not only Lake Chivero but all of the country s wetlands. The past 15 years have witnessed gradual deterioration of Lake Chivero s standards, recreation and tournament hosting. The lake supports mountain biking, cross country running, bird watching, fishing and sailing among other activities. Ideally, Government would want to see Lake Chivero develop into a premier centre for equestrian, sailing, rowing, swimming and other sporting activities for recreational purposes and competitive sporting activities as well, said Minister Hlongwane.Lake Chivero has been in the spotlight for containing high levels of solid and other forms of pollutants despite being the major water supplier for the greater part of Harare.
