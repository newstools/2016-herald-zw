Margaret Matibiri and Faith Mutema Government has called for the tightening of the country s borders to curb the spread of Peste des petits ruminants (PPR) viral disease affecting small livestock in the SADC region. The Government met with Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and SADC representatives in Harare last week and discussed strategies to eradicate and control PPR. PPR, also known as sheep and goat plague, is a highly contagious animal disease affecting small ruminants.The disease kills 30 to 70 percent of infected animals. Speaking at the event, Deputy Minister of Agriculture, Mechanisation and Irrigation Development (Livestock) Paddy Zhanda said the unofficial trade of sheep and goats with other countries was a cause for concern. Of concern is the porosity of some of our borders, the ease with which small ruminants can be transacted through barter, social exchanges and other informal trade mechanisms, as well as the involvement of wild ruminants in the transmission of the virus. It is a huge threat especially in places like Mukumbura near the border of Zambia where the first outbreak was reported but is spreading fast into the surrounding areas and it is saddening that our farmers are ignoring the procedures needed to acquire livestock leading to goats dying in devastating numbers. But we continue to monitor the situation and control movement of animals without permission from the veterinary services, said Hon Zhanda. He said ruminants were an important commodity in the countries economy and human welfare. Goats and sheep are an integral part of the livelihood of not less than 90 percent of our main rural populations.Small ruminants are important in food and nutrition security as well as incomes, he said.
