WEST BROMWICH. Sergio Aguero was branded Manchester City s Special One after ending the worst run of manager Pep Guardiola s career. Argentina forward Aguero scored twice in the first half against West Bromwich Albion before setting up the third for Ilkay Gundogan, who also grabbed the final goal in City s 4-0 win at the Hawthorns on Saturday. It was a welcome result for City boss Guardiola, who had gone six games in all competitions without a win. City remain top of the English Premier League soccer table on goal difference ahead of Arsenal despite their recent struggles and they can now look forward to tomorrow s Champions League clash against Barcelona with more confidence.Aguero s double took his tally to 13 goals this season and he will chase his 150th for City when Guardiola s former club visit Eastlands this week. After dropping Aguero for City s 4-0 defeat at Barcelona recently, Guardiola was delighted with the contribution of the former Atletico Madrid star. Sergio is a special player. But I would like to convince him how important he is for us, Guardiola said. We need him a lot and when he s in that mood and shows that hunger, Sergio is definitive. He s an important part of this club and we want to try to help him to become a bigger and bigger part of this fantastic club. Sergio is so important for us. We don t have too many strikers we have Sergio and Kelechi (Iheanacho) but he s too young and he has to learn a lot. Aguero was sacrificed for tactical reasons in the first meeting with Barca, but Guardiola admitted his talisman has earned his place in the team for the return. Asked if the marksman will start against Barcelona, he said: I think so! But I m not going to tell you which position! Guardiola was also pleased with Gundogan after the German playmaker netted his first brace in English football. AFP.
