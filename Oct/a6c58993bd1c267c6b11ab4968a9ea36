Faith Mutema and Margaret MatibiriPolice have recorded over 2 000 cases of girl child abuse countrywide since the beginning of the year, a figure the authorities say is a cause for concern. Speaking at the International Day of the Girl Child commemorations in Harare yesterday, police spokesperson Senior Assistant Commissioner Charity Charamba said, the abuse rate was distressing .She said, At least 10 cases of girl child abuse are being recorded daily and the ZRP is concerned. There has been an increase from 2 200 cases recorded in January to August last year to 2 251 this year, said Snr Asst Com Charamba.She said it was disturbing that most of the victims were being abused by relatives. The fact that children are mostly raped by people that they know is worrisome. The majority of offenders in progressive order are close relatives, neighbours, strangers and boyfriends, church mates and herd boys, among others.RELATED ARTICLE Girls voices count Most of the cases occur in victims own or neighbour s houses, followed by those that occur in the bushes or at school, said Snr Asst Com Charamba.She urged girls to report whenever they were abused and the community to work with the police in apprehending sexual abuse perpetrators. We have to train our girls self-control whenever they are lured into a dangerous position like exchanging sex for a mere packet of jiggies or biscuits. They should have the ability to say No , to any form of violence. Children need awareness and constant supervision so that they do not fall into obvious traps that are destructive like alcohol and drug abuse, which they can easily copy from their peers, she said.Snr Asst Com Charamba said police would bring to book pimps assisting in the running of brothels in places like KwaAntoney in Hopley and paBooster in Epworth. Our young girls are being abused in brothels and this is our number one priority. She applauded Plan International for partnering with the police to advocate for girls rights.
