The Mighty Warriors hogged the limelight in August as they represented the country at the Olympic Games in Rio de JaneiroGrace Chingoma Senior Sports ReporterZIMBABWE S Mighty Warriors received just the tonic they needed ahead of their African Women Cup of Nations campaign next month, with Government yesterday stepping in to ensure there is funding for them ahead of their departure for Cameroon. In the week that Zimbabweans celebrate the International Day of the Girl Child, Government and the corporate sector came together to rejuvenate the Mighty Warriors preparations for the tournament scheduled t0 run from November 19 to December 5.The Mighty Warriors hogged the limelight in August as they represented the country at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro, becoming the first sport team since the Hockey Golden Girls in 1980 to take part at the global showcase.Coach Shadreck Mlauzi and his charges have however, been hamstrung by an acute lack of resources.Yesterday, Sport and Recreation Minister Makhosini Hlongwane led the way in resource mobilisation for the Mighty Warriors when he brought Government together with some of the corporate executives in the country in a noble cause to raise funding for the women s senior team.As a result of the minister s initiative, a steering committee was set up during a breakfast meeting at a Harare hotel. The committee is expected to start work urgently as the Mighty Warriors are still to get into camp owing to limited resources. Hlongwane told guests at the meeting that the Mighty Warriors require $300 000 to cover all expenses from camping, preparations, air fares as well as allowances.After deliberations on why companies should partner the Girl Child, transparency of the funds, the guests also had suggestions on how to raise the money within a short period of time. It was then resolved that a working committee which has coordinators would initiate projects and fundraising programmes. The fundraising committee with 10 people from different companies is going to be chaired by the leading financial institution Old Mutual Group Marketing executive Lilian Mbayiwa.Mbayiwa will be deputised by CBZ Holdings Senior Manager Group Marketing Joel Gombera. Old Mutual are heavily involved with sponsoring sporting codes such as tennis and rugby, with an ongoing development partnership with the Zimbabwe Rugby Union which covers the Community Cup, the Under-13, Under-17 and Under-18 teams that take part in the annual South African youth tournaments the Grant Khomo Week and Craven Week festivals as one of their biggest contribution to sport.The financial concern were also the official sponsors of the Young Sables when Zimbabwe hosted the World Rugby Under-20 Trophy in April. However, the company has never really been involved with the country s flagship sport football. CBZ Holdings are not new to partnering with football having in the past involved themselves with the Premier Soccer League as the main sponsor.The bank also once sponsored the CBZ FA Cup, the Warriors and paid for the upkeep of former national team coach Clemens Westerhof.They have also been involved with the cricket national team as well as the ZRU.The committee s other members include Zimplats Holdings Head of Corporate Affairs Busi Chindove, Pricewaterhouse Coopers managing partner Tinashe Rwodzi, Telecel Public Relations Manager Francis Chimanda, Rainbow Tourism Group Corporate Communications and Innovations manager Pride Khumbula, Open Minds marketing consultant managing director Darren Thompson, PSMAS Account manager More Moyo, Zimpapers Public Relations and Corporate Affairs manager Beatrice Tonhodzayi and ZBC SFM s Darlington Mackenzie.The meeting was also attended by deputy governor of Reserve Bank Charity Dhliwayo and representatives from other companies such as Nicoz Diamond Insurance, NetOne and MBCA bank.Hlongwane who will also sit on the committee promised the corporate world that the funds would be handled transparently and the presence of an accounting firm Pricewaterhouse Coopers would ensure that the working committee and the ministry will be held responsible for all the transactions.The Minister acknowledged that usually the corporate world are reluctant to partner football due to previous abuse of funds and bad publicity associated with the sport. Hlongwane pledged to ensure there was mileage for the sponsors. The Mberengwa East legislator said there is great value in supporting the girl child especially from the women leaders who have rose up the corporate ladder through perseverance which is also abundant in girl child athletes. Our sport seems to be rising in terms of profile on the back of successes of women that is true of hockey which is going to participate in Chile next month in the World Cup finals, that is true of netball who are champions on the African continent that is true of women s football, following their qualification for the Olympics Games. There has been a sedentary approach in terms of resource mobilisation for women football. As a country there is need to support this successful team. The team is preparing for the Africa Women Cup of Nations and they require $300 000 to fulfil the Cameroon trip next month. With resources available the team is supposed to be in camp and playing some friendly matches. We wanted a scenario where they go and camp in Ghana a week before the tournament begins, but all that can only happen when there is money, said Hlongwane.The Mighty Warriors are in a tough Group that includes hosts Cameroon, Egypt and neighbours South Africa as they seek to make an impact and possibly conquer the continent at the 10th edition of the Women s Nations Cup.
