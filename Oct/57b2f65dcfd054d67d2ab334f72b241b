LONDON. &#8211; Chelsea icon John Terry looks primed to be thrown straight back into action today against struggling Hull in a bid to end a run of two successive English Premier League soccer defeats. Both losses to Liverpool and Arsenal have been since Terry damaged ankle ligaments but having returned to training this week and with England central defender Gary Cahill out of form the 35-year-old club captain is needed more than ever.Terry, who looked to have ended his Chelsea career at the end of last season only to accept a year long contract, has quickly emerged as a central figure in Antonio Conte s plans after the Italian missed out on his main defensive targets during the recent transfer window.The arrival of David Luiz and Marcos Alonso on transfer deadline day at least bolstered the defensive numbers but neither player has made a significant impact since then.Luiz s partnership with Cahill in central defence has looked anything but convincing.Fixtures (all 4pm unless stated otherwise)Today: Swansea v Liverpool (1:30pm); Hull v Chelsea; Sunderland v West Brom; Watford v Bournemouth; West Ham v MiddlesbroughTomorrow: Manchester United v Stoke (1pm); Leicester v Southampton (3:15pm); Tottenham v Manchester City (3:15pm); Burnley v Arsenal (5:30pm) &#8211; AFP.
