BARCELONA. Pep Guardiola s legacy at Barcelona will never be forgotten, according to Barca defender Gerard Pique, ahead of the Manchester City manager s return to the Camp Nou tonight. Pique was a major part of the Guardiola side that won 14 trophies in a golden four-year period between 2008 and 2012. Pep made a mark on all of us that were with him, there was a before and after. We understood football in a different way and he changed the history of the club, said Pique yesterday. I only have complimentary words for him. He gave me the opportunity to come here and gave me everything. City travel to the Camp Nou without a win in three games as draws at Celtic and home to Everton sandwiched Guardiola s first defeat in England at Tottenham Hotspur.However, Pique believes City are already a more dangerous prospect than in the four meetings between the sides in the last 16 of the Champions League in 2013/14 and 2014/15 when Barca emerged victorious on all four occasions.
