Beitbridge BureauA 47-year-old South African man has been arrested by a special police anti-corruption unit, the Hawks, for allegedly issuing identification documents to illegal immigrants, among them Zimbabweans. The Hawks are South Africa s Directorate for Priority Crime Investigations (DPCI), which specialises in investigating organised crime, economic crime, corruption and other serious crimes.In most instances, these targeted crimes are referred to the Hawks by that country s Head of State or the South African Police Service (SAPS).The Hawks provincial spokesperson for Limpopo, Captain Mapimba Maluleke, said they arrested Simon Pelle on Sunday following a tip-off in the Tom Burke area.He said the man had since been charged for impersonation, fraud and contravening some sections of that country s Immigration Act. The suspect appeared at the Phalala Magistrate Court, where he was remanded in custody until the 17th of October, pending further investigations. His arrest came after we received information that he was in possession of Home Affairs stamps and that he was assisting foreign nationals to get fraudulent birth certificates and ID books, wherein they had to pay for his illegitimate services, he said.Capt Maluleke said they recovered home affairs name tags, application forms for birth certificates, fingerprints pads and R7 000 cash.He said further investigations into the matter were underway.The arrest comes a few weeks after two senior South African immigration officers from the same province were arrested by the Hawks, for taking bribes from Zimbabwean travellers and asylum seekers entering the neighbouring country through Beitbridge Border Post.The suspects were arrested following intensive investigations which began in 2012.The arrest brings to 18, the number of people who have been arrested in Limpopo Province between May and August this year on charges of corruption and fraud.In May, 15 people including police and immigration officers, along with customs clearing agents, were arrested on allegations of facilitating illegal migration among other underhand dealings at the Beitbridge Border Post.They were arrested following investigations conducted over a period of six months.Four people have been arrested on the Zimbabwean component of the border since the introduction of secret cameras after they were seen taking bribes from travellers.Among those arrested are two police and two immigration officers.The incident comes shortly after the South African government gave Zimbabwean authorities the nod to deploy officers to issue passports, birth certificates and national identity cards to locals residing there.Deputy Home Affairs Minister Obedingwa Mguni said the documents would be issued at selected points in the neighbouring country, as soon as the South African authorities identify sites to conduct the exercise.He said they would also approach Botswana to carry out a similar programme.
