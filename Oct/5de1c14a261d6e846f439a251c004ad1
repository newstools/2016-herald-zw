KUALA LUMPUR. Food outlets in Muslim-majority Malaysia must rename hotdogs or risk being refused halal certification, a government religious authority said yesterday. The ruling, which also includes other food items whose name includes the word dog , has garnered much ridicule on social media.It follows complaints by Muslim tourists from overseas, said Sirajuddin Suhaimee, director of the halal division from the Department of Islamic Development. Any (halal) products that make consumers confused, we have to change, he said. In Islam, dogs are considered unclean and the name cannot be related to halal certification. Numerous street vendors and halal restaurants sell hotdogs in Malaysia. Sirajuddin said checks would be made step-by-step when these outlets renew their two-year halal certification with the department. AFP.
