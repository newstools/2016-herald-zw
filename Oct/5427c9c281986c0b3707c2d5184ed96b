MILAN. Italy defender Leonardo Bonucci expects a more motivated Spain to come seeking revenge for their early exit at Euro 2016 when the sides meet in a mouthwatering 2018 World Cup soccer qualifier in Turin tonight.Italy host La Roja at Juventus Stadium in what is their first meeting since Spain s 2-0 last-16 defeat to the Azzurri at the Stade de France in June ended their hopes of a record third consecutive European Championship crown. Both have since undergone coaching changes, Giampiero Ventura replacing Antonio Conte at the Italy helm and Julen Lopetegui stepping in for Vicente del Bosque. While Spain put eight unanswered goals past minnows Liechtenstein in their opening Group G qualifier in Leon last month, 10-man Italy returned from Israel with the points from a battling 3-1 win in Haifa.In his second competitive game in charge, after succeeding now-Chelsea manager Conte during the summer, Ventura is under pressure to deliver. And Bonucci warned: We re expecting a different Spain side with respect to the one we faced at the Euros. They will have fresh motivation, they ll be in a new state of mind and looking to avenge their Euro 2016 defeat. We have to step up a gear with respect to how we played against Israel. Asked if Spain were favourites, he added: Totally, yes. And if we re to upset predictions we ll have to play like we did at the Euros, with pace, commitment and by being clinical in front of goal. Barcelona and Spain midfielder Sergio Busquets admitted on Tuesday: At the Euros we made a few slips but now it is time for revenge. Qualification for the World Cup is at stake here. Expectations that Spain and Italy will stick to the form book and take maximum points from remaining home and away fixtures against Macedonia, Liechtenstein, Israel and Albania remain high. With only the group winners progressing automatically to the finals in Russia, that means Italy and Spain s direct encounters take on special importance. AFP.
