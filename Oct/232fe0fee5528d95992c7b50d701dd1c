Tedious Manyepo Sports ReporterTHE Zimbabwe National Boxing Control Board has defended the entrance fees being charged by Oriental Quarries Boxing Promotions for the non-title bout between WBC silver welterweight champion Charles Manyuchi and Colombia s Jose Agustine Feria at the Harare International Conference Centre on Friday.Fans who will opt for Section A have to part with $50 while those in Section B will have to fork out $15 with fees for the rest of the 5 000-seater arena pegged at $5.ZNBCB secretary-general Patrick Mukondiwa said the fees were justified considering that there will be eight professional bouts on the night. It is Oriental Quarries Promotions which are responsible for the entrance fees. We only endorsed the prices after we saw that they are justified. Just imagine a night of eight professional bouts going for only $5. This is a WBC-sanctioned event and it is certain that there will be top-notch boxing action on the night. If fans can part with the same amount to watch a soccer match pitting local teams for a game which lasts less than two hours what about for a boxing jamboree involving local and international stars? said Mukondiwa.Seven supporting bouts, including a women s WBC silver welterweight title fight between Zambia s Lolitha Muzeya and Agnes Mtimaukanena of Malawi, will take place before Manyuchi take to the ring against Feria.Meanwhile, Manyuchi s local sponsors Mr T35 have promised a car to the fighter after the bout regardless of the result. As per our promise Charles (Manyuchi) will get a car after the fight. We agreed that he gets a car for every bout and we are ready to honour that promise, said Mr T35.
