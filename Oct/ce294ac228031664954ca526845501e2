Tawanda Matanhire Arts Correspondent &#8212; Award-winning songbird Cynthia Mare and Green Ambassador Derick Mpofu have embarked on a country tour to promote their latest single Dzoka Kumba . The duo launched the tour at Alliance Francaise last Saturday when they gave a memorable performance. The show was graced by Mrs Universe International First Princess Tracey Anne Buckely Agget.Merrymakers could not get enough of the performance as they went on the dance floor asking for a repeat of the song. Dzoka Kumba is a song about a couple which separated after a silly argument and they seek to reunite yet pride is taking over from both ends.It was released in August and the duo want to market the song following Mare s return from the UK where she had held several performances. This is the first time Green Ambassador diverted to a love song from his usual environmental focus.Mpofu said they were amused with the support they received during their first show for the tour and will soon be announcing venues intended to be visited. Due to overwhelming support and feedback we received after the show, we shall perform at a different venue in four weeks before we take it to other cities, Mpofu said. Dai Zvaibvira hit-maker, Mare said she was back in the country with all the energy to promote her past projects including her album Shinga which was released late last year. Soon after the release of Shinga , I had to go on a tour as well as my sister s wedding in UK and I could not promote my album locally but I am back with more energy to make sure my work gets to the people it was intended for, Mare said.She said their collaboration with Mpofu was worthwhile as it has led to a promotional tour around the country. I am grateful for the collaboration with Derick as it has marked the beginning of a promotional journey for our Zimbabwean fans, she said.
