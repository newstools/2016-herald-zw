Moses ChungaFaith Mutema Sports Reporter HARARE City coach Moses Bambo Chunga has said FC Platinum should not expect any favours when the two sides clash in a Castle Lager Premier Soccer League tie at Rufaro tomorrow. The Zvishavane miners lead the championship race, a point better than CAPS United, who are away in Beitbridge this weekend. The team has been facing up and downs recently and we have been forced to change our shape since we haven t been consistent, said Chunga. The team has been having challenges due to weekly injuries and suspensions. But we have done our best and we are ready for the game. Our main goal is to go into the game with a positive mind and without fear. Chunga said he expects his men to fire against the leaders. We are trying to strive for the chance of finishing the league in top four and we are hoping to surpass our expectations, he said.
