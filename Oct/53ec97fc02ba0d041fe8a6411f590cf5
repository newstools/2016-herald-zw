In the future girls are going to be always regarded as specialSamara Kudzai RazembaI am very proud to present the gift of the world. The one who has to face the world s pressure. She has to face discrimination in the hands of her own.She is seen as the weaker sex and she is young but is expected to thrive under pressure. This gift is the girl child. Long back, the girl was looked down upon and always compared to boys. Girls were not allowed to get educated up to secondary School because the elders said it was wastage of money. Because of this, girls were now the main victims of early marriage.Girls were forced to marry old and wealthy men without being heard. Girls back then were not listened to. Girls had visions, they had dreams. These dreams of becoming great in life just like the boy child. Girls were deprived of the chance to prove themselves. Educating her is educating the whole world.In the future girls are going to be always regarded as special. Nowadays people understand the girl child more. The girl child is being educated till she becomes someone. Nowadays we have the girl child as our leader. The girls are setting out an example for all genders. Opportunities are being given to girls inorder for them to follow their dreams. In most families girls are becoming the bread winners and they are supporting the family in everythingThe girl also has the right to be heard. Everyone should support the girl child. The girl does everything responsibly.She takes care of her brothers as if she is the one who gives birth to them. She takes care of the house and makes sure that the environment is smart. Once you educate the girl child with love and support, you have educated the whole world. The writer is Form 1A at Roosevelt Girls High.
