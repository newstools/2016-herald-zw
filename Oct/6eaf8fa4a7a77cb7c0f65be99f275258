Fungai Lupande Court Reporter A Chinese businessman was yesterday fined $20 for selling Zimbabwe national flags without authority. Weidong Li (28), who operates a retail shop at the Gulf Complex in Harare s Kopje area, pleaded guilty to contravening the Flag of Zimbabwe Act when he appeared before Harare magistrate Mr Tendai Mahwe. Mr Mahwe fined Weidong or five days in prison. In passing sentence, Mr Mahwe considered that Weidong was a first offender who showed contrition by pleading guilty without wasting the court s time. You bought the flags in China and you were selling them for a profit. The moral blameworthiness is low and I will take into consideration that you will lose your flags. They are forfeited to the State, said Mr Mahwe.Prosecuting, Ms Francesca Mukumbiri told the court that on October 21 this year, at around 5pm detectives were on patrol when they approached Weidong s shop at the Gulf Complex, near the bustling Market Square bus terminus .Detectives found Zimbabwe national flags displayed at Weidong s shop and being offered for sale. They interviewed the shop manager, Jimmy Kasengezi, who implicated Weidong leading to his arrest.Investigations revealed that Weidong was selling the flags without permission granted in terms of the Section 5 of the Flag of Zimbabwe Act. A total of 314 flags were recovered. All the flags were forfeited to the State.
