Gift Gandiwa (27) and Munyaradzi Muchineuta (37) appeared before Harare magistrate Ms Bianca Makwande facing unlawful entry charges. In their application for bail, Gandiwa told the court that he unknowingly bought stolen goods from Muchineuta s wife.In response, Muchineuta said Gandiwa was not being truthful. He is the one who supplied my sister with the stolen goods and my job was to carry the loot, said Muchineuta. My sister who was in the gallery is the one who asked me to carry the goods for her. Asked by the magistrate why the police decided to arrest him and not his sister, Muchineuta said he was nabbed while ferrying the loot.Ms Makwande denied the pair bail and remanded the matter to October 20.Prosecuting, Mr Sebastian Mutizirwa told the court that although the pair was arrested for stealing from two houses, they made indications to eight other houses.He alleged that on August 7 this year at around 10pm the pair approached a house in Mabelreign.They allegedly scaled a precast wall and force-opened a kitchen window and cut the burglar bar to gain entry.The court heard that Gandiwa and Muchineuta stole a 32-inch LCD television set and its remote control worth $300 and went away.The offence was discovered the following day and the complainant reported the matter to the police.The following day, in the wee hours of the morning, the pair went to another house and stole a 42-inch LCD television, a DVD player and a Samsung tablet.The stolen goods were worth $3 525 and some of the stolen goods were recovered.
