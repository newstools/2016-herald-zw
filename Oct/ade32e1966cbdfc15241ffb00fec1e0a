Walter Nyamukondiwa in ChinhoyiA Chinhoyi man was arrested last Tuesday after he had written an Ordinary Level Mathematics examination for his friend who was waiting for him at a nearby bottle store. Arthur Genius Chakanyuka (27) of Kenzamba in Makonde proved not to be such a genius when he wrote an exam on behalf of his friend. Invigilators became suspicious after Chakanyuka failed to produce an entry form claiming that it was at Kasonde Secondary School exam centre.He, however, produced an identity card belonging to one Tapiwa Machimu and invigilators alerted the deputy headmaster. The deputy head searched for the entry form, but still the face on the identity card did not match.He was allowed to sit for the examination while the deputy head searched for the person with the particulars presented by Chakanyuka. The deputy head located Machimu at a local bottle store, but he escaped before the police arrived.However, Chakanyuka was not so lucky as he was arrested soon after writing the examination. A Zimbabwe School Examinations Council (Zimsec) official said candidates are allowed to continue in the absence of concrete proof. He is expected to appear in court on Thursday.
