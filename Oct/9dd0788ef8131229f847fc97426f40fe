The Environmental Management Act (Cap 20:27) defines hazardous substances as any substance whether liquid, solid or gaseous or organisms which are injurious to human health or the environment. How can one identify a hazardous substance? The list of hazardous substances is endless; however, the following characteristics help in their identification. v Explosive &#8211; a substance which is capable of a chemical reaction by producing a gas at such a temperature and pressure and at such speed as to cause damage to the surroundings.Flammable solids &#8211; substances or wastes liable to spontaneous combustion.Flammable liquids &#8211; they are liquids that will ignite easily and burn rapidly.Oxidising substances &#8211; they are substances yielding oxygen and may cause or contribute to the combustion of other materials.Organic peroxides &#8211; these are poisonous (acute) substances liable to either cause death or serious injury if swallowed, inhaled or by skin contact.Infectious substances &#8211; these are substances containing micro-organisms known or suspected to cause disease in animals and humans.Corrosives &#8211; these are substances that by chemical reaction will cause damage when in contact with a living tissue or goods.Toxic &#8211; substances that if inhaled, ingested or penetrate the skin may involve delayed or chronic effects.Effects of hazardous substances on the environment and human healthThe hazardous substances we use in our day to day living, bring with them a number of health effects.In some cases, these substances irritate the skin or eyes, make it difficult to breath, cause headaches and nausea, or result in other types of illness.Some hazardous substances may cause far more severe health effects, including behavioural abnormalities, cancer, genetic mutations, physiological malfunctions that include reproductive impairment, kidney failure among others, physical deformations, and birth defects.Impacts on the environment can be just as devastating. Hazardous substances can kill living organisms in a lakes and rivers, wildlife, or otherwise limit the ability of an ecosystem to survive.Certain hazardous substances also have the potential to explode or cause a fire, threatening both wildlife and human populations.Why monitor hazardoussubstances?In a bid to promote the sustainable management of hazardous substances, the Environmental Management Agency (EMA) regulates the use, storage, transportation, importation, exportation, sale and distribution of hazardous substances in the country.The transit and movement of hazardous substances, hazardous waste and oils through and within Zimbabwe, is prohibited unless they are cleared through EMA check points.EMA s presence at the border posts is to ensure compliance with the national legislation and international conventions on all hazardous substances or hazardous waste that are in transit and those destined for use in the country.Information required whenregistering hazardous substancesRegistration forms can be downloaded from the EMA s website and when completed, submit to any EMA office in nearest and most convenient to you.Details of the principal suppliers, importer/manufacturer, user and keeper of the hazardous substances, as well as Material Safety Data Sheet are required when registering.Additional requirements for transporters:Precautions to be taken for the protection of the public,Certificate of fitness for the horse and trailer of the truck,Registration book of the horse and trailer.The law and hazardoussubstancesThe Environmental Management Act (Cap 20:27) regulates the handling of hazardous substances in the country.The transportation of hazardous substances must be done under a permit/licence as specified in Statutory Instrument 12 of 2007.Any accidental spillage must be reported to EMA both verbally and in writing within eight hours and the transporter should ensure that the area is cleaned up to retain its usable state as read with Statutory Instrument 12 of 2007.All transporters are supposed to clear their trucks or cargo before entry into the country (pre-clearance), failure to do so may attract a penalty.Report all veld fires to traditional leaders, ZRP, EMA and Forestry Commission.
