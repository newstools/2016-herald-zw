LONDON. Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain has issued a play me or lose me ultimatum to Arsenal. The England winger (23) has become a fringe figure at the Gunners after an injury-hit year. And Oxlade-Chamberlain hinted he would quit at the end of the season if he continues being overlooked by Arsene Wenger.The Ox, who has 18 months left on his current deal, attracted strong interest from Manchester City, West Ham and old club Southampton in the summer. He stayed put, but after five years at the Emirates he will consider his options if he remains a bit-part playerHe said: You want to play. I d be lying if I d say it hadn t crossed my mind about needing more game time. I m not happy when I m not playing. There will come a time in my career, and I think I m approaching that, when I do need to be playing more regular football. There comes a time when you have to revaluate things and think whether that s going to be here or elsewhere. I m not there at the moment. Players revaluate their personal situation. And I will do that at the end of the season and see what s happening. I m at a stage where I definitely want to be playing and pushing him (Wenger) to play me. Oxlade-Chamberlain left St Mary s in 2011 in a 12m deal and soon burst onto the scene for club and country.But injuries have set him back while his career has stagnated. The Daily Star.
