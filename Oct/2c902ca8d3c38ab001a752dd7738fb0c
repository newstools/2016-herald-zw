CAPE TOWN. Ignorant selectors, quotas and the European exodus are reasons why the Springboks are a rugby team in ruin, a popular New Zealand scribe believes. Mark Reason, a columnist for the Stuff.co.nz website, has hit out at the Springbok team that lost 57-15 to the All Blacks in Durban last Saturday, saying they may be the worst South African team in history.The All Blacks ran in nine tries to record their biggest ever win over their arch-rivals in 95 years!The win also saw the Kiwis equal the Test record of consecutive wins for major Test playing nations, with 17.It s a record they now share with two former All Black teams and the Springbok team of 1997-98.But Reason feels the All Blacks were some way off their best at the weekend.He wrote: The All Blacks didn t play particularly well. TJ Perenara s service was all over the place, and would have caused real problems if South Africa had anything approaching a rush defence. The line-out, most unusually, lost a couple of throws.
