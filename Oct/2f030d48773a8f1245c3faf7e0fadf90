LONDON. Arsene Wenger says his successor will inherit Arsenal in a far better state than he did because of the work he has done over the past 20 years. During his two decades in north London, Wenger has overseen Arsenal s move from Highbury to The Emirates and won three English Premier League soccer titles and six FA Cups. Wenger s contract runs out at the end of the season and there has been plenty of speculation over the 66-year-old Frenchman s future.It is expected that he will be offered a new deal to stay at Arsenal beyond the summer but talks have not yet started.Looking back on his time in England, Wenger said: I always felt that as a manager you have an influence on three levels. One, on the individual careers of the players you are not successful with every player. Two, on the style of play and the results of the team. Three, on the structure of the club . Mailonline.&nbsp;
