The Zimbabwe School Examinations Council wishes to inform all its stakeholders especially examination centre heads and candidates that the Zimsec 2016 examinations season has begun in earnest and, therefore, all measures should be taken to ensure the security of the examinations. ZIMSEC has taken all necessary steps within its capabilities to ensure that all deserving candidates access this examination with minimal disruption and without prejudice.The council is appealing to all its stakeholders individually and severally to be vigilant and be on the lookout for rogue elements in the midst of our communities that are bent on discrediting our education system by violating the integrity of our examinations.Heads of examination centres, schools and all institutions that handle examination materials are advised to increase security in and around their premises especially at night to ensure that examination materials in their custody are not stolen and sold to the public or prematurely opened.Centres are encouraged to be on the lookout for some people within the system who collude to prematurely open question papers and coach individual students or groups using examination questions they pretend to have spotted .Candidates are warned not to entertain any persons purporting to be selling examination questions but to report them to the police or Zimsec.Candidates are encouraged not to participate in any forms of examination malpractice because this would results in their examination results being cancelled and their being barred from taking Zimsec examinations for two years.Be wise and report examination malpractice.The council, in conjunction with the police has deployed armed law enforcement agents in all strategic examination holding centres nationwide to deal with any individuals including teachers, headmasters, administrators and any members of the public bent on breaching the security of this examination.The community is advised that the deployed armed law enforcement details are under strict instructions to deal decisively with anyone who threatens the security of this examination.We, therefore, advise you to ensure that you observe the following:Schools and cluster centres should cooperate and accommodate the security officers deployed in their centres during the course of the examinations.Examination centres should ensure that they have secure strong rooms and chub safes to store and secure examination materials.Examination regulations should be observed to the letter by all examination administrators.Examination centres should put in place a 24 /7 internal security arrangement to ensure that internal and external personnel and candidates do not pre-maturely access the examinations.Examination centres should be on the lookout for individuals and groups that convene examination couching vigils with exaggerated urgency during this period.Heads of centres should take an active interest in the nature of the content that is circulating in tutorial groups during swot leave.Schools shall not keep question papers for more than two consecutive examinations. All question papers shall, therefore, be kept at Cluster Distribution Centres with armed security details.Zimsec and the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education has deployed examinations monitoring teams throughout the country to ensure maximum adherence to examination regulations. Please cooperate with them and assist with any information that will lead to the curbing of examination malpractice.There would be some detractors who will go about conning candidates that they have the current examination year s question papers. Alert Zimsec immediately.Let us protect both our candidates and the examination system from fraudsters.Invigilators must be people of impeccable professional standing and integrity. Those professionals who stoop low to facilitate cheating in the examinations must be exposed and excluded from the system.Should members of the community continue to tolerate and accommodate examination thieves and cheats who continue to plunder our examinations with impunity without reporting them, Zimsec will be left with no choice but to cancel without replacement any centre s examinations whose candidates are implicated in examination cheating. Such centres will have their candidates barred from taking any Zimsec examinations for two years without recourse.We have an obligation to ensure that we deliver a credible, valid and reliable examination to all our candidates and we endeavour to do so without disruption from uncooperative members of society.Zimsec takes this opportunity to wish all candidates the best in the forthcoming final examinations.
