Herald ReporterGovernment yesterday released the October pay dates for civil servants which will see members of the Zimbabwe National Army and Air Force of Zimbabwe receiving their dues tomorrow. Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare Minister Prisca Mupfumira said the health sector would get their salaries on October 25 while members of the Zimbabwe Republic Police and Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Services would be paid on October 28. The education sector will be the next on the list and they will get their salaries on November 3, she said. The rest of the civil service will be paid on November 8 and pensioners will follow on November 11. Grant-aided institutions are the last to be paid on November 15. She said Government was doing all it could to ensure salaries were paid within the month worked. At the moment, the revenue collections are not allowing such a situation but it is our hope that in the coming month things will be back to normal, she said. We will continue talking to the civil servants associations to keep them posted on what will be happening in Government. Recently, we engaged them and it was a very successful workshop and we will continue negotiating and helping each other until the workers conditions of service improve. Government two weeks ago held a three-day engagement with civil servants appraising them of their conditions of service and non-monetary incentives.The workers were also informed about the ongoing civil service rationalisation exercise, the impending introduction of bond notes, the shift in pay dates as well as pensions and medical aid benefits.Government invited experts in various fields to the meetings. This culminated into a meeting between the workers and the Ministry of Local Government, Public Works and National Housing where modalities to come up with a specific housing scheme for civil servants were worked out.
