The Bulawayo giants are in the hunt for a possible league and cup double following a strong run in the last two months.Akbay s men have won nine straight matches in both the league competition and the Chibuku Super Cup and will be looking to maintain that form on Sunday.But the Dutchman is cautious ahead of the home date with the Premiership newboys.He believes they could be party spoilers if taken lightly. I think we are prepared for it, we can t wait for the game. We are all excited, the team spirit is very good. It can only be that way in our camp because we have been winning our matches. But I know Ngezi Platinum, we have played them a few weeks ago and we are now aware what kind of opposition they are. No doubt, they are a good team so we don t have to underestimate the competition we expect from them, said Akbay.The Bulawayo giants have all their players available for this match except for striker Nhlanhla Ndlovu who is being monitored by the medical team.Highlanders needed a penalty shoot-out in the quarter-finals after they were held to a 1-1 draw by neighbours Bulawayo City.Akbay, however, is looking for improved performances from his charges.Ngezi Platinum have had a fine run in the tournament.They have scored seven goals in the two matches they played in this tournament.Tonderai Ndiraya s men beat Hwange 3-1 in the first round and then hammered Tsholotsho 4-1 in the quarter-finals at Baobab.Defending champions Harare City are still in the running and will face Norman Mapeza s FC Platinum at Mandava tomorrow.FixtureTomorrowFC Platinum v Harare City (Mandava)SundayHighlanders v Ngezi Platinum (Barbourfields).
