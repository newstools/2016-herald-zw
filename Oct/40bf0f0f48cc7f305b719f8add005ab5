Does his fashion has a future Tafadzwa Zimoyo Fashion Talk 263Hello weekend, the beginning of new life for another week ahead. The red carpet is a beautiful setting for people. I think everybody appreciates it, loves it and honours it. Nobody really acts foolish because they know this is a special occasion.According to United States award-winning actress and now style icon Jada Pinkett art should never be limited the beauty of art is that it gives us the freedom to go places where we wouldn t go to in our normal lives.She said inside, you are so many different people.You can go from the pretty girl on the red carpet to the singer at Ozzfest, spitting in the crowd.Yes, this week I am focusing on red carpet after the last week s show the MTV Africa Music Awards 2016 (MAMAs) held in Johannesburg, South Africa and next week we will have our Zimbabwe Radio Awards.For our local celebrities please watch out next week as Yours Truly will fashion police you.Red carpet fashion refers to the outfits worn on the red carpet at high profile gala celebrity events such as award ceremonies and film premi res.The clothes worn to award events such as the Grammy, MTV, Emmy, Oscars and the Golden Globes among others consistently receive intense worldwide media scrutiny, making their red carpets an international product placement area of great importance to fashion designers.The Queen B slayed in the black numberPrior to the 1990s, many celebrities chose their own red-carpet dresses, with the Oscars being remembered for some extraordinary and eccentric outfit choices, including torn denim, sequinned jumpsuits and even Indian headdresses.For ceremonies such as the Golden Globes, it was rare to see a star dressing up formally until the late 1990s, with many nominees turning up casually dressed.When Halle Berry came to the 2000 ceremony in a glamorous white Valentino dress, it was described as a game-changer which set the standard for Golden Globe red carpet style, and according to Phillip Bloch, her stylist at the time, began the time when a dress could actually make a career .The stylist s role is to try to ensure that the client only receives positive publicity for her appearance and is not featured on worst-dressed lists.One of the most widely publicised and talked-about red-carpet gowns was a ready-to-wear green Versace gown worn by Jennifer Lopez to the 42nd Grammy Awards ceremony on February 23, 2000 and to date the trend now has spread to Africa.The 2016 MAMA was filled with spontaneous, glamorous, and elegant looks from Africa s biggest stars As Pulse said, from Sarkodie looking dapper in a monochrome ensemble and Khanyi Mbau showing her behind to the world.Whether their look was a hit or an epic fashion fail, the celebs who attended the awards all get bonus points for paying attention to the runways at international fashion shows.It is true that black and white were the stand-out colours of the night.Celebrities like Bonang Matheba looked striking in a sculptural Marchesa gown and Miss SA Ntandoyenkosi Kunene opted to wear sophisticated black head-to-toe.Personality Dineo Moeketsi whose OTT outfit didn t go down well with the fashion police on Twitter was one of those who kept it summery in all-white.Others, such as actress Minnie Dlamini and singer Yemi Alade, who won the Best Female Act award, mixed it up with a combination of the two timeless hues.There was no shortage of sparkle on the red carpet with several celebrities vying to outshine each other in glittering gowns.See-through designs and lingerie-inspired dresses were prolific on the catwalks at Paris Fashion Week, where they featured in the collections of designers like Louis Vuitton and Chanel.That said, transparency is a trend that doesn t always translate well from the runway to real life as some celebrities showed on the red carpet.Get it right, and sheer outfits can be feminine and sexy.Get it wrong and they can look more streetwalker than chic.International music star, Future, proved to many that he has no future in fashion.Future rocked up to the red carpet looking like a homeless street-kid attending a wedding. What he managed to do was to wear clean clothes.Does it mean that these international stars don t really care about giving their African fans an international standard of work when they come to perform in the so called motherland?When Future rocked up to the red carpet looking like a homeless man, it was not really much of a surprise.Instead, what was surprising was that he didn t even bother changing his torn t-shirt and jeans when he performed at the award show.Next time Mr Future, avoid disrespecting us. Or perhaps you were actually showing us who you really are.Red carpet should be taken serious, unless you wanted to start a new trend, but you are not Kanye or Lady Gaga.For the rest, dress properly for the red carpet and carry your confidence.You need to know that when celebrities dress, they know they are putting on a show for the cameras.They practice and perform under the lights and cameras for a living so showing up at an event with people watching is just a natural extension of the stage.Build your confidence, and you will find it easy to wear styles that push the envelope and still manage to look effortless.The key is to become comfortable with the idea of having people stare at you when you walk into a room.Never be afraid to be the best dressed man or woman in the room.Most men are very comfortable with situations wherein somebody can just walk past them. These men do not mind blending in which is why no one takes a second look.When a man peacocks or in some cases just dresses in a manner that outshines his surroundings, he attracts a higher level of attention from others.Enjoy your fashion weekend.
