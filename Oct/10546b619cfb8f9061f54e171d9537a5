Killer ZivhuFrom George Maponga in Masvingo&#8212; Zanu-PF Masvingo Province has surpassed its provincial cash target for the forthcoming 16th Annual National People s Conference after raising $52 000 through donations from individuals and companies. The province had set a target to raise $50 000 for the ruling party s indaba. Besides surpassing the cash target, Masvingo has also managed to raise a record 52 live beasts to feed delegates at the conference. I am happy to announce that we have so far managed to raise cash donations from Masvingo sons and daughters together with local companies amounting to $52 000 and by the end of this week we expect the figure to have surpassed the $60 000 mark because more donations are coming, said Cde Killer Zivhu, chairperson of the provincial fund-raising committee and Zanu-PF Masvingo provincial secretary for finance. We now also have 52 live beasts in the bag to feed delegates who will come for the conference and the figure is also more than the target that we had set as the province, said Cde Zivhu (pictured below).Part of the $52 000 cash donation, added Cde Zivhu, came from Lowveld sugar cane producer Tongaat Hulett that poured in $10 000 while Masvingo Housing Consortium comprising Vashandi Housing Co-operative and December 12th Housing Scheme and others also chipped in with $10 000. All the funds that we received were forwarded to the national party (Zanu- PF) headquarters from where the province will make requests as and when the need to use cash locally in conference preparations arises, Cde Zivhu said.Politburo member Cde Josaya Hungwe praised Cde Zivhu and his team for their fundraising drive that had put the province on course to host the mother of all Zanu-PF conferences .Cde Hungwe urged Cde Zivhu and his team to extend their fund-raising activities beyond Zimbabwe s borders to regional countries such as South Africa, Botswana and Namibia where many sons and daughters from Masvingo were working.The ruling party has already said this year s conference in Masvingo will not be elective and will instead focus on coming up with resolutions to revive the economy among other pressing national challenges. Masvingo last hosted the Zanu-PF National Annual People s conference at Masvingo Teachers College in 2003. Last year s conference was held in the tourist resort town of Victoria Falls in Matabeleland North province.
