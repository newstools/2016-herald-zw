Tafadzwa Zimoyo Fashion Talk 263Phew, the weather is getting hotter and hotter.I hope you are managing well and the good thing is that Zimbabweans know how to adapt easily to any situation.This week was fun-packed, with top musicians releasing sizzling colourful videos. What I can say on the productions is that they now know how to dress well.I think local stylists are doing well to extend that. Even Lady Gaga or Beyonce will not only go green with envy but can learn one or two things especially on the hot material, African print.Enough of that, back to our closet.Summer is the time for tiki drinks and roof decks, for finger food and flip-flops.In summertime, people dress casually and think they re allowed everywhere with that dress code.When it comes to fashion and season women know best how to spot and be trendy while men just follow what is close to them.There is an outcry over men who are wearing shorts to town and on social media some were blasted, but come to think of it, women should respect and understand that shorts were first invented for men.Shorts are an essential style staple again, whether you like it or not but there should be a guide not just we are wearing them because it is summer.The most important thing to bear in mind when picking shorts is how they make you look.Never skip a leg day? For thicker thighs, darker colours with slim and lighter fabrications will fit more comfortably, said Ward Welly a popular internationally acclaimed tailor. The dark tones will contribute to the look of a lean physique without undoing all your hard work in the gym. If you re more of a slimmer build, well-chosen shorts can add perceived heaviness to your legs. Multiple pockets, buttons, contrasting trims and pleats to the thigh all add flattering weight to skinnier bottom halves. Busier shorts will add texture and weight to your legs, the opposite of the bigger man s slimmer, darker offerings.You also need to choose shorts to make you taller or shorter.Whether you re average or too tall height, all shorts are created equal.Generally, I would say stick to on the knee and just above for all styles, anything above mid-thigh is strictly for poolHowever, one length doesn t mean one style.For the last few seasons, smarter shorts have benefited from a quiet turn-up.They add a casual touch to slimmer chino styles, and lend the summer cargo an even comfier finish.Bear this in mind when shopping for length; the ideal chino short will skim the knee fully extended and land just above when turned up one degree.While you hesitate over leg-length, spare a thought for how high you re intending to have the shorts sit on your waist.If you have got a longer torso, higher waists (above the hip) will even you out.It works the other way too; stockier men should take advantage of shorts resting just above their hips.They will extend the body and add height minus the need for Cuban heels.Another tip is choose shorts to suit any occasionGenerally speaking, the lighter the material the more holiday-friendly the shorts become.Hardy denim styles are suited for casual wear, whereas chino and linen are more versatile. A slim, tailored chino style is perfect for warm evenings with a white linen shirt and loafer, said Tawanda Javangwe from Hatfield.Javangwe s classic summer look is perfect for garden parties and barbecues, feeling smart while still relaxed.For those who are more into style, choose shorts to go with your outfitSummer is all about a bare ankle with every shoe.If you re worried about sweaty feet, pack a sock that sits below the line of your shoe for covert comfort.To conclude on the shorts, remember the other major accessory you will need to consider is a good belt.Even a casual polo and chino-short combo reaches new heights with a clean loafer and a smart black belt.Contrasting colours a dark belt with light shorts, for example helps to break up a look, an effective tactic for taller men.A black leather belt will go with any shorts you would care to pick.This week on ladies, we won t dwell much on shorts because they have managed to make them look hotter, it was just the men who have been having identity crisis when it comes to fashion.Still on summer, obvious footwear matters.Are sandals your best friend this season?Well, when you are wearing a pair, you can t help but have a good time.In fact, we think sandals represent everything that s fun about life all wrapped up in a pair of shoes.Like the flip-flops begging to be taken out of your big sling bag , sorry my manners, I am still to find out the name of those handbags you are moving around with.Favourite of many this hot weather is the gladiator sandals that make you stand out and the wedges that give every outfit a little extra boost.And obvious, they are the summer sandals you wear from May to November (because no matter what the temperature is, some shoes are just too cute to put away).Make sure those feet are not only for walking but need the fashion sense too, by decorating them.Enjoy the hot weather and keep fashion alive.
