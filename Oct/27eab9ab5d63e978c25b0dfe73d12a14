JOHANNESBURG. Highlands Park goalkeeper Tapuwa Kapini considers the arrival of Gordon Igesund as the kind of injection the club needs in their bid to stay in the Absa South African Premiership. An opening-day win against PSL rookies Baroka followed by defeats to Kaizer Chiefs and Polokwane City, then a draw with Cape Town City followed by a massacre at the hands of SuperSport United has prompted the club to take the route of change on the bench.Allan Freese has immediately been replaced by Igesund and will now work in the club s development. At Highlands Park we are a hard-working team and I think at the moment the mood was okay. In terms of losing I think we have learnt from those defeats and there are things that we now need to fix before it is too late, says Kapini. I think we have a coach (Igesund) who is ready to fix all the things and I think we are going to work with coach Gordon in a way that will make us strong. The Zimbabwean also feels as players they need to take more responsibility. We have not been playing well enough as a team with too much individuality but I think as a captain and a senior player we have been ready to talk about it because we see the need to pull up our socks, he notes. The coaches can do their jobs during the week but it is us that need to pull up our socks. Maybe we have not been hungry enough to win. As players we just need to lift up our game and really look into our attitude about what we have been doing wrong and doing right on the field of play. The veteran keeper s attention is now on the Telkom Knockout date against Chippa United tomorrow night at Makhulong Stadium. We are in this cup to try and compete to win it. We want to win it as well. There are 16 teams involved and so we are going to come up with a plan since we already have the players and a coach so we just need to work together, he adds. Kickoff.com
