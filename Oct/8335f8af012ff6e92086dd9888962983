MANCHESTER. Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho said Paul Pogba needs time to fulfil his full potential in England after the French midfielder scored twice in a 4-1 win over Fenerbahce. Pogba, a world-record 89 million pounds signing from Juventus, scored a penalty and a long-range effort in Thursday night s Europa League group game at Old Trafford.The 23-year-old is yet to hit the heights since returning to United after four years in Turin, but Mourinho believes such performances will help expedite the bedding-in process. First of all, in some of your mouths, he goes from the worst player in the Premier League to a great player in 48 hours, Mourinho told reporters. I am not specifically saying it is you. I say media, especially the Einsteins. We know he is a very good player. We know he needs some time to show his potential. I know Italian football very well. I know teams play completely different from the Premier League. I am not saying we are better, but we are different: different in the intensity, the number of touches on the ball, everything is different and he needs time to adapt. He is a self-confident boy. He was not depressed because some people said he was a bad player.He was calm. It is always nice for a player to score, to score at home and especially to score such a beautiful goal. AFP.
