Wiggins. Stone High School s football team was making a name for itself as the Tomcats turned around years of mediocrity with a winning season under the school s first-year coach. But now the south Mississippi school s football programme is known for something else a black junior varsity player who says as many as four white students put a noose around his neck during an October 13 football practice. At a Monday news conference, the Mississippi NAACP demanded a federal hate crime investigation. No child should be walking down the hall or in a locker room and be accosted with a noose around their neck, NAACP president Derrick Johnson said during a news conference in Wiggins. This is 2016, not 1916. This is America. This is a place where children should go to school and feel safe in their environment. Hollis and Stacey Payton, parents of the alleged victim, attended the news conference but didn t speak. Their son, an unnamed sophomore, wasn t present. The NAACP said the incident happened during a break in football practice and that the noose was yanked backward while on the student s neck.Johnson wouldn t say whether the noose left marks. State NAACP spokesperson Ayana Kinnel said the family indicated the student returned to practice after the incident. Stone High has about 800 students, about a quarter of whom are black, according to state figures.The school is the only public high school in the 18 000-resident county. Mississippi has struggled with a history of racial division. It is the last state that still incorporates the Confederate battle emblem in its state flag. Agencies.
