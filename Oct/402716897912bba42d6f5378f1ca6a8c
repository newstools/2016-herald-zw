CAPE TOWN. The hype was centred around the return of Jannie du Plessis and the continued omission of Duane Vermeulen, but there was something else that stood out from Allister Coetzee s Springbok squad selection on Saturday. Coetzee named a 33-man squad that will travel to the northern hemisphere for rugby Tests against England, Italy and Wales next month.And, significantly, there was no Morne Steyn. Steyn had been rushed into the Bok squad in the June Test series against Ireland when Pat Lambie was left concussed following the first Test in Cape Town. He had played second-fiddle to Elton Jantjies for the rest of that series.
