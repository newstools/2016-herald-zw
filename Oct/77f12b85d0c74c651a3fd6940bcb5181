Productivity in some local manufacturing industries has gone up by an average of 30 percent to 50 percent aided by the restrictions on importations of certain products introduced over three months ago, the Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI) said. The Government at the beginning of July this year introduced Statutory Instrument 64 of 2016, which placed a blanket ban on imports of a long list of consumer goods and hardware that are being produced locally in a bid to stimulate local production.Those wishing to import the restricted products are now required to apply for import permits from the Government.While consumers and mostly cross border traders roundly criticised the move as blocking their freedom to purchase and consume products of their choice, local manufacturing industries are beginning to reap the benefits of the restrictions.CZI president Busisa Moyo told delegates at the launch of a trader transaction card that Zimbabwe s manufacturing has not died . Production is 30 to 50 percent up because of some statutory instruments that have been introduced, Moyo said.The cooking oil and bottling companies are among those that have recorded a huge boost in production as a result of the import restrictions.The trader transaction card is a partnership between the CZI and the Zimbabwe Cross Border Traders Association (ZCBTA) which is backed by Steward Bank.The card will benefit members of the association who will be able to access financing options and buy goods, at a discount, for trading purposes from companies that are members of CZI.Mr Moyo said the partnership was a recognition that cross border traders were business people in their own right.He said there were a number of locally made products that cross border traders could help market outside the country.ZCBTA secretary general Augustine Tawanda said the initiative was a game changer. The platform creates opportunities for the traders to get discounts for exports, he said.Mr Tawanda said the card would also offer huge financial benefits for cross border traders. &#8211; New Ziana.
