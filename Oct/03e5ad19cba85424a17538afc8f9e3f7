LONDON. Swansea have sacked Francesco Guidolin and will appoint American Bob Bradley as their new manager Guidolin leaves the Liberty Stadium on his 61st birthday after less than nine months in the role and is the first English Premier League boss to lose his job this season.

The 58-year-old, who took charge of one final Le Havre game against Sochaux last night, will be the first American to manage in the Premier League.City chairman Huw Jenkins said: We are delighted Bob has agreed to join us. He is highly regarded as a coach and has a wealth of experience on the international and domestic front. He is well aware of the club s footballing philosophy and will provide us with strong leadership qualities and a renewed belief to compete at this level-move forward in a positive way. Sky Sports.
