This is also free of charge, he said.Zhou said Makhabane flies in this Friday ahead of the Heal Zimbabwe concert and prayer night. The highlight of the whole event is the Heal Zimbabwe concert on Friday which will be centred on interceding for good things to come towards the nation of Zimbabwe. This will be a time for Zimbabweans and visitors from outside the country to interact through art. The family fun day and music gala slated for Saturday is an all day event till late with Zimpraise, bringing the curtain down on the same at 9pm, he said.He said they were happy to have brothers and sisters from across the Limpopo to help them celebrate their 10th anniversary.
