Johannesburg. Faf Du Plessis scored a century as South Africa trounced Australia by 142 runs in the second One Day International at the Bidvest Wanderers Stadium in Johannesburg on Sunday to go 2-0 up in the five-match series. Australia won the toss and sent South Africa in to bat first with the hosts posting 361 for six in their 50 overs with man of the match Du Plessis making 111. The Australians struggled to keep up with the required rate and were bowled out for 219 after 37.4 overs with Wayne Parnell claiming 3-40 in seven overs. It was an amazing game. Dare I say that it was almost the perfect batting and bowling performance from the team, said captain Du Plessis at the post match press conference. The guys did the basics well today and that took the pressure off me when I came in as the scoring rate was good, added Du Plessis, who now has three centuries against Australia.Quinton de Kock (22) and Rilee Rossouw (75) gave the hosts a good, solid start by adding 70 runs for the first wicket off 66 balls before De Kock tried to force the issue and was caught off John John Hastings (10-0-57-3). Du Plessis and Rossouw then continued to add to Australia s woes by adding 76 off 80 balls for the second wicket. Hastings then dismissed Rossouw, caught in the deep after facing 81 deliveries and striking 10 boundaries but that brought JP Duminy to the crease. Du Plessis and Duminy started slowly, but then built momentum, bringing up their 50-run stand off only 45 balls. They increased the pace to register their 100-run stand off a further 40 balls before their partnership was brought to a close on 150 off only 111 balls.Du Plessis caressed 13 boundaries in facing 93 balls while Duminy smashed 10 boundaries and three maximums before playing onto his stumps. For 82 off 58 balls, off the bowling of Mitchell Marsh (10-0-68-2). We thought 330-340 was par today and we know that this is a high-scoring ground. We had a lot of inexperience today but it is a good challenge for the guys playing against experienced guys like this, said Steve Smith after the match. We thought we pulled it back nicely at the back-end but the damage had already been done up front and we couldn&#8217;t contain them in the middle overs, added the Australian captain.The Australians struggled to mount any sort of attack as Dale Steyn (7-0-37-1) and Kagiso Rabada (7-0-31-2) produced a fiery opening spell which saw the back of Aaron Finch (1) in the second over off the bowling of Rabada.
