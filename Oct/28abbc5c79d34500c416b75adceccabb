KINSHASA. An opposition leader in Democratic Republic of Congo was arrested late on Sunday for his role in anti-government demonstrations last month in which more than 50 people died, the government and his party said yesterday. Bruno Tshibala, the deputy secretary-general and spokesman for the Union for Democracy and Social Progress (UDPS), Congo s largest opposition party, was arrested Sunday night at Kinshasa Airport as he prepared to board a flight for Brussels, the UDPS said in a statement.Government spokesman Lambert Mende confirmed the arrest, saying Tshibala was scheduled to be questioned by the attorney-general s office yesterday over his role in the protests, including the deaths of a police officer who was burnt alive and a young girl. He is among the people who organised the protests of (September) 19th and 20th, Mende told Reuters. Tshibala signed a communiqu in which he congratulated the protesters. Congo s attorney-general has said he will punish those behind the demonstrations, which were against President Joseph Kabila s alleged attempts to retain power beyond the end of his final term in December.The UDPS, which has promised further protests, called for his immediate release.President Kabila, in office since 2001, is barred by constitutional term limits from standing for a third elected term but the country s electoral commission says it needs until December 2018 to organise the vote due to logistical and budgetary obstacles.
