LONDON. Pep Guardiola has warned his former club Barcelona: I m coming back to beat you. The Manchester City boss has been unbowed by a win-less run of three matches and says he will not abandon his principles just to avoid defeat on his return to his spiritual home in the Champions League soccer tomorrow night. Not too many teams have won there in recent years but I never approach a game thinking a draw will be a good result, he said. We have four games left in our group and we need to win two to be in the next round. And we are going to try to get the first of those points in the next game, that is for sure. I know the way we want to play but, of course, we have to understand exactly who we are facing. Will a draw be a good result? It depends on the game. If we play like we did against Everton then it is not a good result. But if Barcelona play much better than us then maybe it is a good result. Guardiola is ready to leave penalty-taking responsibilities with Sergio Aguero even though the striker has missed an astonishing six spot-kicks in 2016. Aguero followed up his miss for Argentina against Paraguay last week by seeing his tame effort saved by Everton s Maarten Stekelenburg who also saved one from Kevin De Bruyne on Saturday.
