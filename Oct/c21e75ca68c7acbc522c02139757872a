Kelvin KainduOscar Rusenga in Triangle Triangle (1)1 How Mine (1)2 HOW Mine came back from a goal down yesterday to beat Triangle United in coach Kelvin Kaindu s first return to Gibbo after the Zambian international led the Lowveld side to their best finish in the Castle Lager Premiership soccer last season. The match was evenly contested, but Kaindu managed to complete a double over his former employers after collecting maximum points in the reverse fixture in Bulawayo. As much as we picked maximum points, I give all the credit to the team, we came from a goal down and we responded and managed to get an equaliser, said Kaindu. Triangle opened the scoring as early as the 12th minute when How Mine s Mbare-born goalkeeper Munyaradzi Diya gave away a corner after failing to clear Milton Ncube s back pass.Hardlife Mavhundi then rose high to head the ball home after a well-worked corner between Dzingai Chirambamuriwo and Nhamo Lameck with the latter providing the assist.Kaindu made a tactical change, bringing in veteran striker Kuda Musharu for Stephen Nyambabvu and that was the game changer as they got their equaliser shortly after. The visitors goal came in the same fashion as the hosts early goal, but this time defender Kudzai Chideu was on the end of a mix-up between Ronald Mudimu and his defenders to equalise from close range.Adolf Muganyi, who was a marvel to watch the whole afternoon, capped his efforts with a goal that proved to be the match winner for the visitors in the 54th minute.
