MANCHESTER. Jose Mourinho has told Wayne Rooney he needs to move if he wants regular first team football. The Manchester United boss has informed Rooney s advisers that he simply cannot guarantee him a starting place any longer. While he is not actively looking to sell him he does not want to keep Rooney s camp in the dark about his future plans. That is a future at Manchester United in which Rooney will no longer be the central figure. He has not started the last four league games.A muscle injury was given as the reason he was not in Sunday s squad at Stamford Bridge.Club captain Rooney turned 31 on Monday with his career now in limbo. It is now down to him to decide what to do with opportunities in the America s Major League Soccer and in China.His current contract still has this season and another two to run. At 250 000 a week other clubs would have to think hard at picking up that tab. There could, however, also be a negotiated pay off with United on his release to ease that burden.There is now the real prospect that he may never eclipse Sir Bobby Charlton s all time goalscoring record that he looked certain to surpass.He is still three short of that 249 record which has stood for more than 40 years. Rooney did not even take either of the penalties they were awarded in the 4-1 win over Fenerbahce. His next club will be LA Galaxy, according to the bookies. Ladbrokes have put LA Galaxy as the favourites to sign Rooney at just 4/1, with any Chinese club next on 5/1. The Sun.
