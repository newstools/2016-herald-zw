LONDON. Former captain Darren Sammy says the West Indies who are set to tour Zimbabwe soon are in a mess but insisted he had no regrets over a passionate speech that effectively ended his international career. The 32-year-old all-rounder has not played for the West Indies since captaining the team to a dramatic last-over victory against England in the World Twenty20 final in Kolkata in AprilAfterwards, an emotional Sammy used the presentation ceremony to say how his side felt disrespected by the West Indies Cricket Board s lack of support, with a pay dispute having previously threatened the team s participation in India. Put me on that podium again and I will do it even better, said Sammy yesterday. I believe a man has to speak his heart. It was just an extension of what my team went through flowing from me. Sammy was speaking just two days after the West Indies suffered a crushing 133-run second Test defeat by Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates. That left them 2-0 down in the three-match series and was their 19th loss in 29 tests.On the eve of the tour, the WICB led by controversial president Whycliffe Dave Cameron sacked winning World Twenty20 coach Phil Simmons, a former West Indies batsman. It s disappointing but not surprising, said Sammy, also the West Indies captain when they won the 2012 World Twenty20. It s been a trend of how my former employers operate. It was sad. They will say it did not have an effect on the team but, from the pictures being posted on social media, I could tell my team was not in a happy mood. Sammy, the first cricketer from the island of St Lucia to represent the West Indies, insisted he was at peace with his own situation. Everything in life happens for a reason, he said. AFP.
