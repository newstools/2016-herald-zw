Innocent Ruwende Municipal ReporterGovernment has granted local authorities the nod to install prepaid water meters as this will ensure timeous payment of bills as well as improving service delivery. In an interview Local Government, Public Works and National Housing Minister Saviour Kasukuwere said Government had also warned local authorities against overcharging residents. The city must collect revenue, especially water revenue. It must improve its revenue collection methods. Let them roll out those programmes so that we can be assured of improved cash-flows and also ensure that town authorities deliver water to the residents. Look at how zesa cured the problem of debtors, whether Government or corporate sector. zesa introduced the prepaid system and to a very large extent, all these departments have to pay and are paying. For as long as the prepaid systems are in place, they enhance efficiency and we are continuing to receive electricity in our homes because we can purchase it and the service can be given, he said.Minister Kasukuwere said most residents were saddled with estimated bills and that Government wanted to bring about fairness as well as justice by making sure that what was given was what was paid for.He urged local authorities to close the loopholes in revenue collection.
