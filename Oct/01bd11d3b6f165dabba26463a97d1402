The conference, dubbed the Local Government Investment Conference (LOGIC), is expected to attract 400 participants who include delegates from the 32 urban local authorities, representatives of industry and commerce, and regional and international investors.LOGIC organising committee chairperson Councillor Hubert Fidze said installed infrastructure was failing to cope with an ever-increasing urban population. Most of our cities and towns are facing quite a number of challenges which you the members of the media have been highlighting for a long time. As the City Fathers we have been struggling to address these challenges with limited budgets, said Cllr Fidze. Having realised our common challenges as urban local authorities, we have together decided to host an investment conference. Our major aim is to showcase investment opportunities available in urban Zimbabwe to local and international investors. Zimbabwe s development trajectory is guided by Zim- Asset, he said.Local authorities, through the Ministry of Local Government, Public Works and National Housing, are housed in Zim-Asset s Social Services and Poverty Eradication, and Infrastructure and Utility Clusters.
