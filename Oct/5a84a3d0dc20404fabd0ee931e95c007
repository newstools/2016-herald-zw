Paul Mundandi Sports ReporterNORMAN Mapeza and Lloyd Chitembwe are two of the three coaches battling it out for the Castle Lager Premiership title this year. And a woman who saw them grow up in Chitungwiza is proud of what they are doing. I saw the two grow and at one point I even wanted to discourage them from playing football in the dust streets of Chitungwiza, said Lloyd s mother, VJ Chitembwe, who is a legislator. I was even against the road runs and the idea of taking football seriously, but they have gone places with football which is the most beautiful game in the world. I am proud of Norman (Mapeza) and Lloyd (Chitembwe). They have made me proud. As a mother I am very proud. I saw them grow and they played together and I am excited about their achievements. I want either FC Platinum or CAPS United to win and I am always praying for the two. I will not be happy to see Highlanders winning the league because I want a member from the family (Norman or Lloyd) to win the title.
