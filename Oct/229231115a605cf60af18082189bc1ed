Extremely happy he told us. The rumours about his so-called nuptials reached fever pitch after he appeared on Real Talk with Anele Mdoda wearing a wedding ring. Except Twitter detectives got it wrong. Because the ring is on the wrong hand. That ring is actually from my grandmother and I have always worn it the DJ told us. So no wedding . . . for the moment.
