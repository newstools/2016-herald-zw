LONDON. Tyson Fury has had his boxing licence suspended pending further investigation after a long meeting of the Boxing Board of Control stewards on Wednesday. It comes just 10 months after he defeated Wladimir Klitschko to win heavyweight boxing s No 1 position.In a short statement, the BBBofC said: The British Boxing Board of Control confirms that Mr Fury s boxer s licence is suspended pending further investigation into anti-doping and medical issues. Fury s licence has not been removed yet, with a procedure to be followed in which the board will invite Fury to a hearing to discuss admission of cocaine use, and two alleged failed random drugs tests which showed up cocaine metabolites, taken in September by the Voluntary Anti-Doping Association, the Las Vegas based organisation.The Boxing Board statement yesterday was preceded by a press release from Fury s promoter, Mick Hennessy the previous night in which the unbeaten 28-year-old heavyweight officially relinquished the World Boxing Association and World Boxing Organisation heavyweight titles.Fury said: I feel that it is only fair and right and for the good of boxing to keep the titles active and allow the other contenders to fight for the vacant belts that I proudly won and held as the undefeated heavyweight champion of the world when I defeated the long-standing champion Wladimir Klitschko. I won the titles in the ring and I believe that they should be lost in the ring, but I m unable to defend at this time and I have taken the hard and emotional decision to now officially vacate my treasured world titles and wish the next in-line contenders all the very best as I now enter another big challenge in my life which I know, like against Klitschko, I will conquer. While Fury is undergoing treatment for depression, a race to fight for the vacant titles will take place with Anthony Joshua (IBF champion), Wladimir Klitschko (WBO and WBA No 2), Joseph Parker (mandatory challenger for the IBF and WBO) and Luis Ortiz (WBA mandatory, and recently signed by British promoter Eddie Hearn) the main men in the frame.WBO president Francisco Valcarcel told American news outlets on Wednesday that the WBO could set up a four-man box-off for the vacant title involving the leading available contenders: Parker of New Zealand, Klitschko, No 3 Andy Ruiz Jr and No 4 David Haye.
