Two girls, Langa Mpofu and Kayael Sibanda have made history by being named in the Streak Cricket Academy Under-13 boys squad for a tour of South Africa from December 10-17. Mpofu (11) is a Grade 5 pupil at St Thomas Aquinas, while Sibanda (9) is in Grade 3 at SOS School.The squad will play against leading Gauteng academy Rowlin National Cricket Academy from Boksburg and Mumbai India, a premier academy that recently confirmed its participation in the three-nation academy contest.Joseph Rego, chief executive officer of the Old Mutual Heath Streak Cricket Academy, said this was the first time girls would be playing alongside boys in an international tour aimed at scouting cricket stars of note. He said it has been their endeavour to support young talented girls and afford them similar training at the academy to inspire and encourage the girl child to get involved in playing cricket. I have never been a national selector, but most of my predictions have always been accurate. These two girls will make the national team in a few years time, said Rego.He said the confirmation of Mumabi India for the South African tour was a bonanza for them, as the academy was still celebrating Streak s appointment as national team head coach.Rego said Streak s appointment had boosted morale at the academy and their coaches Boxie Mxolisi Dube, Thabo Mkhululi Mboyi and Shaun Joseph were geared to face a tough challenge in their first international tour against some of the best youngsters in schools cricket.The Streak Academy s inaugural international tour will see the Under-13 and Under-14 teams playing in a T20 triangular series with Mumbai India and Rowlin National Cricket Academy.The academy s two Under-13 teams will tour under the names Masca Heath Streak Academy Zimbabwe and Pepsi Heath Streak Academy Zimbabwe, while the Under-14 team uses the name Fazak Heath Streak Academy Zimbabwe.
