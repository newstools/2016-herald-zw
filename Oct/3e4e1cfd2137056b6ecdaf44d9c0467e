Two million tonnes of maize on 400 000 hectares are expected to be produced.Cde Matuke also said the Deputy Chief Secretary apprised them on the reasons why President Mugabe did not assent to the Special Economic Zones Bill.He said President Mugabe had reservations on a clause which seeks to suspend the Labour Act whose effect would have exposed workers to serious abuse by employers. As the party, we want to thank President Mugabe for the observations he made regarding the Bill. Both houses had omitted serious issues and the deficiencies that were seen by the President need to be addressed by both houses, he said.
