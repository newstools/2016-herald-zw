Minister MuchinguriInnocent Ruwende Senior ReporterEnvironment, Water and Climate Minister Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri has implored African countries to unite and reiterate the need for climate financing to support adaptation in addressing poverty and building climate resilience in developing countries when negotiating at climate talks to be held in Morocco next month.Minister Muchinguri-Kashiri who was addressing a local, Pre-22nd Conference of Parties to United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP22) meeting in Harare said African countries should not divorce the Paris Agreement with important national, regional, continental and international initiatives. As we negotiate, let us clearly demonstrate the synergy among our nationally determined contributions (NDC), adaptation and mitigation projects, Africa Agenda 2063, the Sustainable Development Goals 2030 Agenda and Paris agreement. Let us ensure that all that needs to be done before COP22 such as ratification of the Paris Agreement is done immediately. During COP22 like we did with the recently ended CITES COP17, we need to assign specific duties to members of the delegation so that we maximise on pushing for Zimbabwe s interests that are in line with the Africa Group, she said.Minister Muchinguri-Kashiri said the successful coordination of the implementation of the Paris Agreement will not only ensure that Zimbabwe is in compliance with the convention s requirements, but will enable the nation to track its progress towards building a climate resilient and low carbon nation as well as creating green jobs and reducing vulnerability of communities to climate change impacts.She said the country s NDCs dovetail with Zim-Asset in addressing food security, sustainable energy access and value addition. There is a direct nexus between our NDCs with Africa s development aspirations as underscored in Agenda 2063 which embodies the vision of the Africa we want . The 2030 agenda for sustainable development sets global targets with a vision of living no one behind , she said.She said developed countries should continue to put more effort towards addressing climate change as they are largely responsible for the current changes in the earth s climate system.Climate Change Management Department, acting director Mrs Veronica Gundu-Jakarasi said Zimbabwe position on Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC) was that parties should fulfil their commitments and obligations based on their national capabilities and right to attain sustainable development. Equity is about historic versus current responsibility for climate change, the role of annexes, and the role of each country should play in the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change climate negotiations. Developed country parties should provide adequate support to developing countries to enable them fully and effectively fulfil their obligations, she said.
