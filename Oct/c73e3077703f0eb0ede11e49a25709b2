Partson ChimbodzaTawanda Marwizi Arts Correspondent &#8212; Several musicians will unite for award-winning promoter Patson Chimbodza s birthday bash set for Andy Miller Hall next month. Chimbodza, who runs Chipaz Promotions, has worked with various local and international artistes at big shows for over a decade and some of the musicians have seen it fit to celebrate with him.Musicians Oliver Mtukudzi, Alick Macheso, Jah Prayzah, Andy Muridzo, Ammara Brown, Freeman, Soul Jah Love and Sandra Ndebele among others are set to perform. Most of the artistes on the list have been there in my journey as a promoter. I have been promoting music for the past 12 years and it was not rosy, he said.He recounted how Mtukudzi gave him money for fuel to travel from Mozambique after their tour flopped. We organised some shows in Mozambique and the last one in Tete was a flop. I was stranded and Mtukudzi came to my rescue and gave me money to return home, he said.Chipaz said as he celebrates his birthday he has realised the weakness they have as promoters. We tried to form a promoter s union but it all failed because we are not united. Yes, it is my birthday but we need to come together as promoters to have events that uplift Zimbabwe showbiz, he said. I am one of the promoters who managed to stand with Zimdancehall when it was gaining momentum. There was need for grooming for most of the young stars and I think I did my best, he said.Turning to his relationship with other promoters he said they have no problems. Now we have 2 Kings coming on board and we are working with them on some of the gigs. We consult each other and we do not have any problems, he said.Musicians that will take part at the celebrations said they are ready to celebrate the promoter s big day.
