NEW YORK. White House candidate Donald Trump desperately needed a strong debate performance against Hillary Clinton yesterday, with stakes sky-high following intense scrutiny of his treatment of women and damaging footage of him making lewd remarks. His unprecedented, outside-the-establishment presidential bid, and the embattled Republican Party with it, was thrown into disarray by his misogynistic comments, with growing calls from top Republicans for him to step aside.Even before the latest fallout, Trump was already in need of a moment of political magic to reverse his slide in the polls barely four weeks from Election Day on November 8.Now his campaign has been rocked by its worst crisis, with his crude comments echoing in voters ears, day in and day out. National media have dug up evidence of some of his bad and bizarre behaviour, including agreeing with an interviewer that his daughter Ivanka was a piece of ass .In a 2002 interview with Howard Stern, Trump also said he preferred leaving women over a certain age. What is it at 35? It s called check-out time, he quips. He will want to build a personal connection with these everyday Americans and show his capacity for empathy, a quality that often has been absent in his large, raucous campaign rallies.Despite an angry backlash over Trump s remarks boasting about his ability to grope women as he pleases without impunity, he insisted there is zero chance I ll quit . Late Saturday, the defiant Republican stepped outside of his Trump Tower skyscraper in New York, brandishing his fist to cheers from dozens of supporters.Asked if he was staying in the race, he responded: 100 percent .
