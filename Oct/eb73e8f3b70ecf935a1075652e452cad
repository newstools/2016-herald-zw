ALEXANDRIA. Two women who helped raise several thousand dollars for the Somali militant group al-Shabaab have been convicted of providing support to a terrorist organisation. Federal judge Anthony Trenga found the women Hinda Osman Dhirane of Kent, Washington and Muna Osman Jama of Reston guilty on most of the charges they faced at a hearing Tuesday in Alexandria. The women waived their right to a jury trial. Prosecutors say the women used an online chat room to round up small contributions on behalf of al-Shabab.The women did not deny they were al-Shabaab supporters. But they argued that the money they raised didn t go directly to al-Shabaab. The women could face sentences of 15 years or more when they are sentenced in January. AP.&nbsp;
