PARIS. Southampton goalkeeper Fraser Forster is looking for the English Premier League club to make a massive statement by beating Italian soccer giants Inter Milan in the Europa League tonight. The Saints travel to the San Siro and as many as seven thousand of their fans are expected to follow them knowing a win at the home of the three-time European champions would be a big step towards progressing to the knockout phase from Group K.It would also be another memorable result for a club who were in the third tier of English football just five years ago. If we go and do that (win) it will be a massive statement. You look where the club was just a few years ago and even in the time since I ve joined the club you meet the owner and you meet the chairman, and when we came to the club that s what they said, that they wanted to move the club forward and get into Europe, and every summer they ve backed us, goalkeeper Forster told the club s website. They ve bought players, and step by step we re achieving those goals and hopefully we can do ourselves proud in the game, and if we can come out of it with three points that will be a massive achievement. Southampton, who are fresh from beating Burnley 3-1 in the Premier League at the weekend, have so far beaten Sparta Prague 3-0 and drawn 0-0 away in Israel to Hapoel Beer-Sheva. AFP.
