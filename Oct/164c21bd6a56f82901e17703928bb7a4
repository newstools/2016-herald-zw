Maria SharapovaLAUSANNE. Russian tennis star Maria Sharapova hailed the reduction of her two-year doping ban on Tuesday as one of the happiest days of her life, immediately targeting a return to action in April 2017. The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) cut Sharapova s ban to 15 months, saying she was not an intentional doper , after the 29-year-old tested positive for the banned medication meldonium during January s Australian Open throwing her glittering, money-spinning career into serious jeopardy. I ve gone from one of the toughest days of my career last March, when I learned about my suspension, to now, one of my happiest days, as I found out I can return to tennis in April, said Sharapova, who has racked up 35 WTA singles titles and more than $36 million in career earnings. An April return the ban is backdated to the positive test in January this year meaning she would in theory be able to compete at the French Open in May-June next year. Sharapova, whose ferocity on court, business acumen and glamorous looks have all combined to make her a marketing juggernaut, was hit with a two-year ban by an independent tribunal appointed by the International Tennis Federation (ITF).Reducing the ban after she appealed, the Lausanne-based CAS found that Ms Sharapova committed an anti-doping rule violation and that while it was with no significant fault , she bore some degree of fault, for which a sanction of 15 months is appropriate . In the panel s more detailed, formal decision, it said significantly: Under no circumstances . . . can the player be considered to be an intentional doper . Sharapova openly admitted she had been taking meldonium for 10 years to help treat illnesses, a heart issue and a magnesium deficiency. She always maintained that it had entirely escaped her attention that the product had been added to the banned substance list published by the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) on January 1, just before the Australian Open.
