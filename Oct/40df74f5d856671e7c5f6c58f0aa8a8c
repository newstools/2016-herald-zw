Innocent Ruwende: Municipal ReporterHarare City Council cannot appoint another town clerk until the courts deal with two pending matters which are before the Constitutional and Supreme Courts, Mayor Bernard Manyenyeni has said. In April, the city appointed former NMB chief executive Mr James Mushore as town clerk but Government rescinded the appointment after a council meeting that announced his appointment, saying council flouted procedures of appointing a town clerk as outlined in the Urban Councils Act and the Local Government Board. According to the law in question, council was supposed to submit three candidates to the Local Government Board for approval. Council was forced to send Mr Mushore on indefinite forced leave and since then Mrs Josephine Ncube has been acting town clerk.Several cases were then instituted before the courts and two of them are still pending. Harare residents are accusing the city fathers of not having the interests of residents at heart saying that the city needs a substantive town clerk without any undue delays.&nbsp;
