CALIFORNIA. Angelina Jolie has moved into a mansion in the one of the most exclusive neighbourhoods in the world which is so private you can t even see it on Google Street View. The actress, 41, moved her six children from Malibu into a new rental costing $30 000 a month in Hidden Hills, a gated community in Los Angeles County, California.There, her new neighbours read like a who s who of Hollywood including Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, Miley Cyrus, Drake and Jennifer Lopez.Jolie s new pad boasts more than 8 000 square feet of living space as well as two beach-entry pools, a cascading waterfall and an 800 square foot cabana, according to Entertainment Tonight.But it s the privacy that makes property in Hidden Hills so sought after by celebrities and likely the reason Jolie, who recently made headlines after filing for divorce from husband Brad Pitt, picked it. Our nearly 2 000 residents enjoy a rural, country way of life that has nearly vanished from Southern California, proclaims the Hidden Hills website. The pastoral setting is highlighted by the absence of sidewalks and street lights and by the presence of horses, llamas, ostriches, and the occasional cow. Despite a lack of pavements, its deep setbacks, white three-rail fences, corrals, barns, natural rustic equestrian trails tell visitors that Hidden Hills is a truly special place to live.
