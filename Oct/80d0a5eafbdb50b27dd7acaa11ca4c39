JOHANNESBURG. Maritzburg United s Zimbabwean soccer striker Evans Rusike is back in contention for his side s league match against Golden Arrows after missing the Telkom Knockout last 16 clash against Kaizer Chiefs this past weekend. The Team of Choice are in need of a boost ahead of the KwaZulu Natal derby as they currently languish in 11th place, up against an Arrows who are second. Last season this particular match-up produced controversy as April s encounter at the Chatworth Stadium was marred by an incident where Ernst Middendorp claimed Arrows assistant coach Mandla Ncikazi had kicked him in the face.The German-born mentor also suggested Abafana Bes thende s chairperson Mato Madlala had an undue influence over the match official in a game that ended 1-1.Friday night s game at the Harry Gwala Stadium will be a first meeting between the two sides since that ill-fated evening and Maritzburg should have Rusike back according to club Farouk Kadodia. Maritzburg s chairman Kadodia underlines that Rusike, who featured in all of the club s games before they faced Chiefs, is returning from an injury. Evans Rusike was out injured (in the last game) and he may return on Friday, Kadodia told KickOff.com.Meanwhile, Maritzburg United s communications manager Brian Zuma believes that the performances in the club s last two games, a league draw with Free State Stars and a Telkom Knock-out penalty shoot-out failure against Kaizer Chiefs, are indicative of the quality they possess regardless of the result. The last two games we played has demonstrated what we are capable of. All we need is one victory to turn things around and we can do that against Arrows, Zuma told the club s official site.
