We promised the people and we delivered. I am happy the festival went according to plan from the workshops to the concert. The church should move with times hence we managed to put everything in order despite the change of venue. We used to do our live DVD recording at Rainbow Towers but unfortunately on the same venue there was another function and this did not stop us, he said.He said the DVDs will be ready before the end of the month.Madziyire said the brand has grown over the years and it was now focusing on a number of empowerment initiatives. Through successful workshops conducted by different captains of industry, people learnt a lot. The group is continuing to grow and developing career wise, he said.
