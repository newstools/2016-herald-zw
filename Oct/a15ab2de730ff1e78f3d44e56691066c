AKAJohannesburg. Hip-hop star AKA has urged his fans to help raise funds to save a home for sexually abused and abandoned girls. Taking to social media the rapper showed support for the New Life Centre4Girls which is set to host a gala dinner to raise funds. Unfortunately the home is in debt and needs to come up with R2 million before the end of October or else the home will be closed and the girls will have nowhere to go. It seems like a massive task but if we pull together and do what we can we can make a huge difference in their lives AKA wrote on Instagram.The centre gives girls who were previously homeless a chance to start afresh.AKA encouraged people to make donations to the centre by SMSing LIFE to 42220.
