Our genres are completely different and we know people have different music tastes. People will alternate between gyrating to fast rhumba tunes and listening to soothing jazz. It is indeed a good combination that is likely to make fans feel refreshed, said Lumiere. We have been sharing the stage with musicians of various genres and the trick is working well for us. We have taken rhumba to big crowds when we share the stage with big musicians because we want to show people that the genre is still powerful.
