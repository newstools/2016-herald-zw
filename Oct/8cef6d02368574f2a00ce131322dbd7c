Elroy AkbayTedious Manyepo and Faith MutemaHIGHLANDERS coach Erol Akbay was voted the best coach for the second time when he won the September coach of the month as CAPS United s Leonard Tsipa was voted the best player. Akbay s team have managed to win five last matches. Bosso opened their winning streak on Week 19 when they defeated How Mine 2-0 before they went on to beat Border Strikers 1-2 as they picked momentum. On Week 23 they were at home against old enemies Dynamos winning 2-1. They continued with the winning trend with a victory at Harare City. Their last match was against Ngezi Platinum and they won 2-1. Tsipa on the other hand has been a revelation for CAPS United where he scored crucial goals and is now the League s top goal scorer. Akbay said he is overwhelmed by receiving this accolade, which for him came as a surprise. It s very nice and I m very happy to be named the best coach of the month. This means a lot for a coach as it shows that everyone appreciate and respects what you are doing for the team. I am also very happy with myself because I know that I have done my part to my full potential and I have done my best for the team. This would be the second recognition for this year and I am hoping for the best, said the coach.Akbay is expected to receive the accolade on Saturday when they face Chapungu, while Tsipa may be handed his at Dulivhadzimu when they clash with Border Strikers. Turning on to the game, the Bosso mentor knows any slip up by his charges at this stage of the league marathon will virtually rule them out of the championship reckoning in a race they desperately need to win to end their decade-long wait for the premiership crown.The Bulawayo giants are on the road to Gweru for a date with tricky customers Chapungu at Ascot this Saturday in a match the Dutch mentor has described as a must-win . Bosso are third on the log standings with 47 points, four adrift of table-toppers FC Platinum who are eyeing their first league title with only five games to play before the curtain comes down on the season. Akbay s charges have gone for six matches without dropping a single point, but he sounded diplomatic ahead of the Midlands tie. Chapungu is a very dangerous opponent. They come at you like a house on fire and if you are not well prepared for their raids then you just crumble. They play good football and they have a very good coach who knows how to play his cards well. But, we are Highlanders, a team with a realistic chance of winning the title if other fixtures go our way. We are ready for the game and I am sure fans will be in for a treat come Saturday. This is a must-win game for us. We need to bag the points if we are to retain our chances of winning the league title. We have to win all our remaining games including the one against Chapungu, but one thing is for certain, we need to respect our opponents because we know what they are capable of doing, said Akbay.Highlanders won the reverse fixture 1-0 at Babourfields early in the season, but Akbay reckons his team will not read much on their good record against Chapungu. Akbay has no injury or suspensions to worry about as he has the whole pool of his players available for the encounter. The expatriate has endeared himself with the Bosso faithful this season after he masterminded a double over bitter rivals Dynamos for the first time in 10 years.
