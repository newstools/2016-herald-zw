DHAKA. England s misfiring top-order will be under pressure to deliver in the second and final Test cricket against Bangladesh starting tomorrow, aware their places could be up for grabs when the team moves on to India. After winning the nail-biting first Test in Chittagong by just 22 runs on Monday, the tourists will be keen to extend their 100 percent record against their hosts when they face off again in the capital Dhaka.England s win in Chittagong was due in large part to the batting heroics of the middle order, with Moeen Ali, Jonny Bairstow and Ben Stokes all playing crucial knocks to repair the damage from top-order collapses.The top four batsmen Alastair Cook, Ben Duckett, Joe Root and Gary Ballance managed a combined total of just 96 runs in both innings.
