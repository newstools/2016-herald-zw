LONDON. Arsenal striker Lucas Perez is set for a lengthy spell on the sidelines with an ankle injury. The Arsenal summer signing, who cost 17million from Deportivo de La Coruna, was forced off after 72 minutes during Tuesday s 2-0 EFL Cup win over Reading. And Arsene Wenger says Perez will be out of action for up to eight weeks after the Arsenal striker was targeted by a stupid challenge from Reading s Danzell Gravenberch. Gunners boss Wenger is furious that Gravenberch clattered Perez in Arsenal s 2-0 League Cup victory at the Emirates Stadium on Tuesday.Perez will now miss a significant portion of Arsenal s campaign with an ankle problem and Wenger is frustrated that Dutch defender Gravenberch avoided punishment for the challenge. Wenger likened Gravenberch s tackle to the incident that led to a red card for Arsenal s Granit Xhaka in a 3-2 win over Swansea earlier this month. The Daily Express.
