Tedious Manyepo Sports ReporterHIGHLANDERS coach Erol Akbay has acknowledged he has never been involved in a fascinating race for the league title like the one his team are in at the moment in his coaching career. With just four games before the season closes, the Dutch mentor finds himself in an intriguing three-horse sprint for the title with table-toppers CAPS United and second-placed FC Platinum.Akbay s Bosso are third with 50 points. CAPS United are chasing a first league title in 11 years, with Bosso seeking to end a 10-year wait for the prestigious title.FC Platinum want to register their name in the Hall of Fame for the first time in their short history. I am a highly experienced coach. I have been a coach for some years now, said Akbay. I know that there is competition in football but it is so fascinating here. To have three teams in such strong positions with only four games to go is something else. I can admit that this is one of the most enterprising leagues I have ever worked in. Akbay s team have a tricky date with cross-town rivals Bulawayo City at Babourfields tomorrow.The Bulawayo giants were held to a 1-1 draw in the reverse fixture with Bruce Kangwa, who has since left for Tanzania s Azam, scoring for Highlanders before Emmanuel Mandiranga denied them the maximum points in the last minute. The game against Bulawayo City is obviously a tricky one and I bet it is going to be one of the best contests to be seen at Babourfields this season. Highlanders play some fantastic football and Bulawayo City are also good at passing. But we are a team which is fighting for the championship. In as much as I respect our opponents, I also want to say we are very confident that we are going to win the match to keep up with the leaders as we try to push for the title, he said.
