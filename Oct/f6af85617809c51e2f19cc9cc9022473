It also gives me pride to celebrate with the people who have been supportive since then. I want urge fans to come and celebrate with us. We are also grateful to Spencer Madziya and Platinum Entertainment for hosting us, said Matema.The celebrations will be a red carpet affair and guests are expected to dress for the occasion.
