Municipal Reporter Harare City Council is set to construct three more clinics and expand four others to increase the scope of services offered at the health institutions. They would include operating theatres, 24-hour casualty and emergency units with doctor coverage, it has been learnt. The move is expected to de-congest referral hospitals in Harare. The city has already completed the upgrading of Mabvuku Polyclinic to a sub hospital. Lack of a secondary level of care in Harare has seen patients being referred from the lowest level of care to the highest level of care in the referral chain.The expansion of the scope of services is expected to increase access to comprehensive health care to Harare residents, who crowd and compete for health services at national referral Harare and Parirenyatwa Central Hospitals.The city says it is going to construct new clinics that include Hopley, Caledonia and Glen Norah at a cost of $210 000 as well as upgrade to satellite status clinics in Highlands, Waterfalls, Kuwadzana and Budiriro at a cost of $300 000. Two mobile clinics will also be purchased. Acting Finance and Development Committee chairperson Clr Luckson Mukunguma said the city was excelling in health delivery services and had assumed national leadership in primary, maternal and child care as well as in the control and management of infectious diseases. Council takes pride in the unprecedented strides made on the health delivery front. The upgrading of Mabvuku Polyclinic to a sub hospital equipped with a theatre is a masterstroke of colossal proportions set to vastly improve health delivery in the eastern district of the city, he said.Early this year, Government handed the administration of Caledonia to the City of Harare for administration. The residents are also now expected to pay rates to the city so that it can provide basic services.&nbsp;
