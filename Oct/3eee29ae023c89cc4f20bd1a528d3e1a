LONDON. Arsene Wenger is out to banish the memory of a surprise defeat by Swansea which shattered Arsenal s hopes of winning the English Premier League soccer title last season. A devastating 2-1 loss at the Emirates Stadium in March effectively ended Arsenal s hopes of catching eventual champions Leicester.Now, as he prepares Arsenal for a Swansea side managed for the first time by American Bob Bradley, Gunners boss Wenger is keen for his side to prove just how far they have come since that painful evening, which ended with some fans calling for his resignation. Last year we had a very negative experience with Swansea who killed our opportunity to win the Premier League, said Wenger, whose side are on a run of just one league defeat in 17 matches since then. We have a good opportunity to show that we have learned from that and that we are capable of dealing with these kinds of opponents. That s what is at stake for us. We have to refocus because the players have been away and we ve basically had nobody here. We have to show that we can deal with the kinds of fixtures where we are the favourites. We were not always capable of doing that last season and we want to show that we have moved forward. AFP.
