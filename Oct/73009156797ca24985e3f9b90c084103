The 53-year-old who was in need of a good result last night in the EFL Cup clash with city rivals Manchester City after the 4-0 hammering by Chelsea on Sunday has yet to find a flat and is living on his own in a luxury hotel.However, that presents its own problems for the Portuguese manager as he says he is under siege from the paparazzi. You know the history of the paparazzi, for the hotel and the brand that sponsors me, the clothes brand, (it) is amazing because they are there every day, Mourinho told Sky Sports. For me it is a disaster because I want sometimes to walk a little bit and I can t. I just want to cross the bridge and go to a restaurant. I can t so it is really bad. But I have my apps and I can ask for food to also be delivered.
