National galleryArts Correspondent &#8212; The National Gallery of Zimbabwe in collaboration with the Embassy of Sweden has made an open call to all photographers to participate in the upcoming Vana Baba Vanhasi/Obaba Balamhla/Fathers of Today competition, dedicated to documenting and showcasing the roles of progressive fathers in Zimbabwe today.The competition seeks 25 of Zimbabwe s best photographers for contest on progressive fatherhood. The project seeks to explore the roles of fathers in Zimbabwe and how their relationships with their partner and child or children have changed in the face of a changing, and progressively more gender equal, world. We invite you to enter our Vana Baba Vanhasi/ ObabaBalamhla/ Fathers of Today , photographic competition, dedicated to documenting and showcasing the roles of progressive fathers in Zimbabwe today and how fathers today relate to and interact with their children, said the curator for education at the National Gallery of Zimbabwe, Tandazani Dhlakama.The open call was made during a recently held inspiration workshop, at the National Gallery of Zimbabwe, which featured delegates from the Swedish Embassy and SAFAIDS, and students from the National Gallery School of Visual Art and Design.Johan B vman from the Swedish Embassy spoke on the qualities that today s father should possess. He highlighted that today s father needs to be open, have time to play with his kids and be a role model to them.During the workshop, the students were also given a platform to debate on issues contributing towards gender inequality. Some of the concerns raised include the issue of early gender socialisation which often leads to gender inequality as girls are taught that they have to obey, and boys that they have to be strong and to be leaders.Another issue raised was that girls often face pressure from society to get educated on how to take care of the home and how they should treat their future husbands, while on the other hand men do not really face the same amount of pressure on how to be fathers from society.Most importantly the workshop highlighted that contemporary society needs to move away from patriarchal ideologies to embrace modern ways that advocate for gender equality.It stressed that gender equality could only be achieved when men and women worked together in partnership. Young men were urged to become role models and partake in advocating for equal opportunities for both men and women.For the Vana Baba Vanhasi/ Obaba Balamhla/Fathers of Today photographic competition, artistes are required to submit only two photographs bearing caption statement, completed and signed entry form, copyright forms and curriculum vitae to enter the competition.A Jury will select 25 outstanding photographers from all cultures, all points of view, with no age limit.

In addition, the artistes will get a free submission review. Participants are urged to submit entry by November 7, 2016 and we believe that every photographer who enters deserves thoughtful feedback on their work.
