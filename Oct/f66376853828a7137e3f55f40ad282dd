The often underestimated significance of the livestock sector to the national economy is highlighted in a policy paper recently released by the LMAC. This also outlines how current policies and regulations are hampering the growth of the livestock sector, preventing farmers and other players in the livestock value chain from reaping the full benefits from their stock &#8211; and reducing the livestock industry s potential contribution to the economic development of the country.The document shows that while agriculture s 11 percent contribution to gross domestic product and livestock s own 22 percent contribution to the agricultural GDP are recognised, the full contribution of livestock at every level is not always fully appreciated.The significant role that livestock plays in human nutrition, foreign currency earnings, and employment creation right down the value chain are not always taken into account. There is potential to use livestock and the livestock industry as an engine to drive further economic growth by reviewing various policies and regulations which are impacting negatively on the livestock sector and on farmers already challenged by drought and climate change.The paper, titled Policies and Regulations Impeding Growth of the Livestock Sector , highlights that existing regulations are working against the attainment of goals in the draft livestock policy, right down the livestock value chain from input acquisition, through to production, marketing and processing of livestock products.Current regulations discourage local production and local use of raw feed materials which the livestock industry is a major user of, such as maize bran, wheat bran, soyabean cake, cotton cake and molasses.To encourage local production of raw materials and lower the cost of locally produced feed raw materials, it is recommended that Government zero rates molasses for VAT purposes and removes all AMA levied fees to grain and oilseeds contractors and buyers. The announcement in the Mid-Term Fiscal Policy Statement that the maize producer price will be set at import parity has been welcomed, and it is proposed that this be based on the landed price of Zambian maize.To facilitate importation of inputs for the livestock industry, various recommendations have been made. It is proposed that Government put in place a policy to encourage importation of wheat grain over processed flour imports. For ease of doing business, it is also recommended that annual registration for feed manufacturers and hatcheries and the issuance of import permits be implemented by a single authority under one roof instead of by several agencies and departments, attracting more costs for the agricultural industry.Genetically modified organisms (GMO) certification for wheat bran should be abolished, recommends the document, as currently no commercial GMO wheat grain is grown anywhere in the world.The paper also proposes the abolition of the EMA regulations on effluent disposal, requiring dairy, beef feedlots, poultry and piggery operations to register and pay annual registration and annual inspection fees and a quarterly waste discharge fee. It is argued that this waste is put to good use enhancing soil fertility for crop production. To further reduce unnecessary costs on livestock farmers, it is proposed that instead of EMA levying farmers using agrochemicals, or more than 200 litres of fuel, that the focus should be on promoting good agricultural practices on correct storage and handling of such chemicals.Also eroding profitability in cattle production today are levies on the sale of cattle. It is proposed that the current levy imposed by Rural Development Councils on sale of cattle, which extends to sale of animals for herd rebuilding as well as slaughter, be replaced by a moderate livestock development sales tax levied only on animals for slaughter. Policies and Regulations Impeding Growth of the Livestock Sector also recommends that in line with other livestock products, table eggs and sheep and goat meat should be zero rated for VAT.Also proposed is the introduction of the new Carcase Classification System drawn up by livestock stakeholders in a consultation process but not yet promulgated by Government. This new system is designed to replace the old system of carcase grading and classification, which unfairly penalises smaller breeds of cattle, which make up the bulk of the national herd, thereby disadvantaging smallholder cattle farmers.The livestock industry is also calling for the implementation of a new livestock identification and traceability system (LITS), accessible to and serving the interests of all classes of livestock owners. Having a LITS accessible to all farmers will help control disease spread, simplify trade in livestock and reduce cattle theft. Policies and Regulations Impeding Growth of the Livestock Sector recommends that Zimbabwe s Livestock Traceability System should be reviewed to better serve the interests of all livestock stakeholders in the value chain.Zimbabwe herd book beef schooland inaugural meat fairBeef School 2016, organised by the Zimbabwe Herd Book (ZHB) will culminate in an inaugural Meat Fair. The two-day intensive Beef School, to be followed by the Meat Fair the day after, is set to take place at the Agricultural Research Trust Farm on the outskirts of Harare next week, from October 18-20. Registration and payment is essential to spaces are limited: contact the LMAC.Beef School and Meat Fair &#8211; a review of the latest global cattle production and marketing trendsZimbabwe Herd Book 2016 Beef School will focus on Meat Quality and Grading. The two-day intensive Beef School with lectures will trace genetic drivers and other cattle production factors in efficient cattle breeding and production which relate to meat quality and grading.Keynote speakers, Kim Matthews, head of Animal Breeding and Product Quality at the United Kingdom s Agricultural and Horticultural Development Board, and Sarah Strachan, Meat Standards Australia programme manager, will set the tone with presentations on how to meet consumer expectations.The two-day programme will examine meat quality from all angles &#8211; breeding and genetics, finishing cattle for prime beef, right through to meat grading and marketing.Other topics of importance include matching feed resources with the cow production cycle, holistic rangeland management and assessing rangeland health, early selection of beef heifers with reproductive potential, beef production from irrigated pastures and a presentation on ticks and tick control.Beef School 2016 will bring participants up to date with the latest global meat market trends. In the 1990s, prime Zimbabwean beef earned a fine reputation on the EU market, but an outbreak of Foot and Mouth disease in 2001 saw the cessation of exports under the lucrative Lome Convention.The annual ZHB Beef School, a key event on Zimbabwe s agricultural calendar, plays an important role in building Zimbabwe s cattle industry. Beef School keeps the country s cattle breeders abreast of important global developments in beef breeding.Genetic progress in cattle breeding ultimately drives production and profitability across the beef industry. The genetic gains achieved by ZHB registered beef breeders will ultimately translate into improved productivity for commercial cattle producers and rural farming communities in Zimbabwe.The inaugural Meat Fair will form a significant part of ZHB Beef School 2016. It recognises the importance of consumer preferences and expectations in determining the type of meat produced. It also recognises the importance of promotion of beef and presentation of the product to the market.Successful beef production starts with the cattle breeder industry. Genetic progress in cattle breeding ultimately drives production and profitability across the beef industry. The genetic gains achieved by ZHB registered beef breeders will ultimately translate into improved productivity for commercial cattle producers and rural farming communities in Zimbabwe.
