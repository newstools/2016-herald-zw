Tedious Manyepo: Sports ReporterTWO Zimbabwean wrestlers will represent the country in the inaugural World Palhavani Championships scheduled for Minski, Belarus, on November 12. The Palhavian style is relatively new after it was incorporated into the global wrestling regime some few years ago and the United World Wrestling is understood to be lobbying for the style to be included in the Olympic Games. The first step in trying to convince the International Olympic Committee to accept the style at the world s biggest sporting fiesta is the holding of the world championships.And Zimbabwe, as one of the most active wrestling countries in the world, have been invited to be part of the historical tournament, which is reported to have attracted more than 60 other nations. Twenty-five-year-old Admire Tagwireyi of Black Rhinos and Zororo s Pardington Mashaire (Jnr) are the two wrestlers who have been seconded to fly high the Zimbabwean flag in Minski.Zimbabwe Wrestling Federation secretary-general Tapiwa Masinire said his organisation settled for the two as they are the best palhavani wrestlers in the country. I can confirm that we have been invited to take part in the first World Palhavan Championships to take place in Minski, Belarus. As a country which has just introduced the style, we had to select the best in the category whom we are very sure will bring back medals for the country. Mashaire is a talented all-rounder and at 19, he still has a lot to offer. On the other hand, Tagwireyi is very much seasoned and we are all confident he will live up to his billing, said Masinire.He said besides being a fighter, Tagwireyi has also been seconded to attend a referee s course a day after he competes in the ring. The army man will also double as Mashaire s coach at the tournament. Masinire said he expected his fighters to acquaint themselves well since there was no much difference between their preferred freestyle and palhavan.
