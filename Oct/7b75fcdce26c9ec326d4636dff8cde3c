Takudzwa Chitsiga and Faith MutemaYADAH Stars return to their hunting ground in a bid to put their Eastern Region Division One campaign back on track when they host Africa Trust in Waterfalls this afternoon. Kuda Masaraure s men stumbled on the road when they lost 0-1 in Gutu last week.But the damage inflicted by that loss was minimal after their biggest rivals Buffaloes could only draw.The club is owned by Walter Magaya who started building his team after cutting ties with Gunners.They are one of the few clubs in the country with their own stadium. Buffaloes have a home tie against Chibi.Meanwhile, Black Rhinos coach Stanford Stix Mtizwa is expecting a tough challenge when he takes on Cranborne Bullets this afternoon at Commando.The game can play a part in deciding the championship race.Rhinos are currently leading with 60 points, seven points ahead of second placed Herentials, despite their 2-1 defeat against ZRP FC last week.The coach said they were under a lot of pressure. We are sweating ourselves out as we want to win this game desperately so that we maintain our lead. The game is tough as most of Commando players once turned out for Rhinos. We will not expect any favours from them despite them being an army side, said Mtizwa.Northern Region FixturesGolden Valley v ZRP Morris (Rimuka); Black Rhinos v Cranborne Bullets (Commando); ZRP FC v Chegutu Pirates (Morris); Herentals v Kariba Waves (MSS B Arena); Shamva v Karoi United (Shamva); Darwin United v Banket United (Pfura); Gunners v Mushowani Stars; Blue Swallows v Flame Lily (Manyame); Commando Bullets v DStv Rangers (Commando 12pm)Central Region FixturesIvan hoe Mine v Blanket Mine (Amaveni); ZRP Beitbridge v FC Platinum U-19 (Dulibadzimu); Shabanie Mine v Chrome Stars (Maglas); ZRP Gwanda v Whawha (Pelandaba); Nichrut v MSU (Peak Mine); ZPC Munyati v Gweru United (Munyati); Jessie v Vumbachikwe (Collen Bawn); Tongogara v Kwekwe Sables (Battlefields).Eastern Region FixturesRenco Mine v Surrey (Maramba), Mwenezana v Masvingo City (Mwenezana), Melfort v FC Mutoko (Surrey), Calvary v Prime Rangers (Paradise), Yadah Stars v Africa Trust (Prospect Grounds), Black Eagles v Mupandawana (Gaza), Buffaloes v Chibi (Sakubva).
