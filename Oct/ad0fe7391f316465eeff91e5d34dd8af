The performance of stock markets in most countries is a barometer of the performance of that economy, said Africa University economist Mr Thomas Masese. The current performance on ZSE is in sympathy with the weak state of the economy.Investing on Zimbabwe Stock Exchange entails a significantly higher degree of country and political risk than does investing in most African markets and most risk averse investors have been shying away from investing on the market, he said.
