With the locals having been relegated, the fans who have been coming in their thousands to back them, deserted them. The visitors could have won the match had their trio of Nhamo Lameck, Marvelous Mukumba and Nelson Meson not fluffed the chances that came their way. Border Strikers coach Luke Masomere introduced two new strikers, William Nyoni and Godfrey Mukambi, in the second half but they could not break the Triangle defence.Masomere said they had started rebuilding the team for next season. We have been relegated and we have started looking ahead. We are looking for a quick comeback and hence we have to rebuild the team now, he said.Masomere said he was still engaging his employers over his future at the club with his contract ending on November 30. Triangle coach David Mandigora said his team could have won by a wide margin. We had the upper hand but our strike-force let us down. However, a point away is better than nothing, said Mandigora.
