Chrissy Teigen, John Legend and baby Luna out shopping under watchful eye of bodyguardLOS ANGELES. Chrissy Teigen s taking no chances when it comes to her family s safety. The 30-year-old model, her Grammy-winning husband John Legend, 37, and her infant daughter Luna, six months, were flanked by a hulking bodyguard Sunday as they visited a New York City Sephora location.On the outing, the FABLife beauty was her typical gorgeous self, wearing her hair in braids with a loose-fitting dark green sweater that hung off her shoulder, tight black jeans and heels, rounding things out with a black purse and dark glasses.Legend looked the part of the coolest man in music, wearing an all-black outfit of a jacket, shirt and pants with sneakers, as he pushed his daughter s stroller.The social media stunner is taking a far more cautious tack after she was shaken to her foundation following the October 3 gunpoint robbery of her pal Kim Kardashian in Paris.The exotic beauty, whose background is Thai and Norwegian, opened up to multiple media outlets about the concern and empathy she s feeling for her friend in the wake of the shocking heist, as well as how it s impacted her own personal awareness of potential predators in her midst.Teigen, who hosts Spike TV s Lip Sync Battle with LL Cool J, was among the stars that showed up to a 20th anniversary party held for Mohegan Sun casino in Uncasville, Connecticut, where she talked in detail about how the violent incident aimed at the reality star in Paris. I have no idea what my life would be like after I can t even fathom it, the former Deal or No Deal model told Entertainment Tonight at the event. Obviously nobody knows how they would react to that kind of situation and I have no idea what I would do. Teigen said that she and the Keeping up with the Kardashians star have been texting in the two weeks since the horrific heist, in which Kim was tied up and locked in a bathroom as they rummaged the private residence at Hotel de Pourtales she was staying at, for jewels and other valuables.Kim, whose avoided social media and has yet to publicly address what happened to her, has been doing great in light of the trauma she suffered, Teigen told the TV Newsmagazine, adding that she was proud of her pal for being back at home and with her babies in Southern California.Chrissy also talked to US about the high-profile theft, as she said she was really scared and knew something was really wrong when she saw a clip of Kim s husband Kanye West abruptly stopping his show in New York, with details scant at the time. He s not the type to do that, she said of West. I remember my heart sank, and to hear the full story, it was really scary. dailymailuk.
