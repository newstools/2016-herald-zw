We are here with our play that discourages early marriages and child abuse. We have lined up several shows and the responses have been overwhelming, she said.Apart from the play Mashusha said they were conducting workshops on dance and theatre. We have some works that begin Tuesday on dance, music and drumming work in Manchester before we go to Leicester, said Mashusha.Mashusha was accompanied by Spiwe Guwera and Jesimine Moyo who are part of the crew. I am happy that the play is making a difference in the UK community. Our main purpose is to educate people on the disadvantages of early marriages and child abuse, he said. The play explores various issues that affect women in society. We have women that are vendors because of issues like early marriages and physical abuse by their men among other various issues. In the play the women will be telling their stories, she said.Mashusha said child labour was one topical issue in the play, saying children were not getting enough time to do their school work as well as have enough time to play. These are some of the issues we seek to explore in the play. We hope people will understand it and take the lessons home, she added.Mashusha said they were also planning to take the play to several places back home. We are making efforts to take the play across the country educating people about child marriages, she said.Recently the group showcased Mama Africa at the Hurungwe Arts Festival that was held in Karoi.
