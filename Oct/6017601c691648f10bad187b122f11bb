As a student one wonders what they are being educated for if the jobs are scarce.It makes you think that the whole issue of getting educated is not worth it after all. However, as you get educated you need to shift your mindset from being an employee to being an employer.Our nation needs people who will start up businesses that generate employment. An interesting fact to note is that most of the successful entrepreneurs started when they were in their teens.It is important to have an entrepreneurial mindset when you are still young. This allows you to focus when you pursue your studies because you would have identified an area of interest. It is in this area that you can provide solutions that deal with the challenges people are facing.With this mindset you are thinking not of the job that the world will provide for you but the service you will provide for the world. This is a powerful mindset which does not allow for limited thinking but allows you to expand your imagination to a world of solutions to current problems.Our government has even developed a new curriculum to incorporate the basic entrepreneurship.So many entrepreneurs started because they had been laid off from work or because they had not found the job they were looking for. Entrepreneurship came as the last option and they struggle a lot to make it.If you start developing your entrepreneurial mindset at an early age, you allow yourself to be best prepared for the moment when you want to start your business.When you prioritise entrepreneurship you give yourself enough time to learn about it and get the necessary skill that allows you to do well when you start your business.There is an old classic saying about success; an early bird gets the fattest worm . An early start in your entrepreneurship journey can give you a major boost, allowing time to build a solid body of experience and room for tremendous growth.As a student you can start developing yourself to be equipped for such opportunities.The good thing is that so many organisations are interested in assisting young and upcoming entrepreneurs.Read about starting and maintaining businesses, how to write business proposals and how to present your idea or business to potential investors.All this requires practice to perfect and when you start at an early age, just like the academic education you are studying, it will give you higher chances of success when it matters most.When you are really serious about starting a business you need to formalise, this means you need to register a company which will run the business. It is important to learn about company registration as well as how you can safeguard your ideas and business proposals.Terence is with zwTEENS an organisation which deals with teens and issues affecting them.
