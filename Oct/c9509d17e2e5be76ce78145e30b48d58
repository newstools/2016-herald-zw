Reason Razao Herald Reporter Zanu-PF National Political Commissar Cde Saviour Kasukuwere yesterday urged Norton party supporters to vote for the party s candidate in the upcoming by-election, saying voting for other candidates who do not represent development will reverse the gains made by the revolutionary party. The seat fell vacant following the expulsion of Cde Christopher Mutsvangwa from zanu-pf.The by-election is set for October 22.Addressing party supporters in Norton, where zanu-pf candidate Ronald Chindedza was repairing boreholes for Garikai residents, Cde Kasukuwere said Government was making efforts to provide tap water and roads in the area. I am happy that citizens in Garikai can access clean water. However, our wish is to make sure that you have tap water in your houses, tarred roads and proper sewerage systems, he said. Let us go and vote for Cde Chindedza. He has been endorsed by the party to carry the flag of development in this constituency, the boreholes are a temporary relief and we are going to make sure that every household receives tap water and a proper sewage system. He said having a zanu-pf candidate as the MP for Norton will guarantee fast urbanisation of the constituency. Cde Chindedza said development and the welfare of Norton residents is at the heart of his campaign. Once elected, I will push for all the developments that are required in Garikai and the whole of Norton, he said.Minister of Youth, Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Cde Patrick Zhuwao urged party members to remain united behind zanu-pf. Cde Chindedza will lock horns with Mr Temba Mliswa, who is contesting on an independent ticket and National Constitutional Assembly candidate Mr David Choga.
