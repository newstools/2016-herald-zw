Paul Mundandi Sports ReporterMOSES CHUNGA believes he has a formula to derail FC Platinum s march towards the Castle Lager League championship at Rufaro this afternoon. It s a tricky assignment for the miners and Chunga said his men have a plan to stop them. I have a target to achieve and I have to meet that target, said Chunga. My target is not stopping Norman (Mapeza) but I am fulfilling a fixture that was planned before the beginning of the season by the Premier Soccer League I am also not going to be playing Mapeza but a team coached by Mapeza. I need maximum points so as to achieve my target. I will not talk about FC Platinum or their success because I was employed to take care of Harare City and I am already looking beyond 2016 as I am building a team. I fear no team in the Premiership, I fear no coach in the Premiership but I respect them all. The Sunshine Boys will be missing the services of Honey Chimutimunzeve, Jimmy Tigere, Learnmore Muyambo and Arnold Chivheya through injury. Chunga said it was interesting that the CAPS United fans will be backing them this afternoon.FC Platinum lead the championship race by a point. Club spokesperson Chido Chizondo believes they will have to be at their very best today. Harare City is a tricky encounter for us and, hopefully, the work the boys have put in this week will bring positive results, she said. City have been doing well and are a good side. Our fate is in God s hands and as a team we can only give 100 percent. Besides Winston Mhango who is out on suspension, our team is ready for the encounter. The team will also miss the injured Nqobizitha Masuku. Walter Musona, with six goals to his credit, will be expected to lead the attack for a side that is yet to lose in the capital this season having beaten Dynamos at Rufaro and drawn against CAPS United.
