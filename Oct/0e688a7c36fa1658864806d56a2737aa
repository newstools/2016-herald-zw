If you keep tabs on employment trends it s impossible to ignore the fact that employees are taking a hard line when it comes to what they want in a workplace. One area where most seem to be in agreement especially Millennial and Generation Z workers is in the rigidity (or lack thereof) of their schedules.Modern employees simply do not want to adhere to a 9 to 5 schedule, as their parents and grandparents once did. They want the freedom to come and go as they please and work from wherever they wish, all the while getting done what they need to.And why should they? Technological advancements in communication and computer systems allow folks to do tasks remotely that used to have to be in the office.Companies that want to attract top talent are learning that they need to identify which positions of theirs can be done remotely or on a non-traditional schedule and advertise them as such wherever great potential employees are looking.Online flexible jobs platform, FlexJobs.com, recently compiled a list of the 250 companies that have offered the most flexible-time jobs in the past three years between October 1, 2013, and October 1, 2016 and placed them in order of volume, showing us all which firms out there are taking the most advantage out of flex-time workers. We listed the top 10 in a slide-show, which you can view below.FlexJobs defines a flexible job as a professional-level job that has a telecommuting, flexible schedule, part-time, or freelance component.
