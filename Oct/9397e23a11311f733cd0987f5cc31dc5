PARIS &#8211; President Francois Hollande told the authors of a book just published that France has &#8220;a problem with Islam&#8221; and there are too many immigrants arriving in the country who &#8220;shouldn&#8217;t be here&#8221;. Hollande made the controversial remarks to the authors of A President Shouldn&#8217;t Say That&#8230; in December 2015, a month after gunmen attacked Paris , killing 130 people. Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also known as ISIS) claimed responsibility for the deadly assault.&#8220;It&#8217;s true that there&#8217;s a problem with Islam. No one doubts it,&#8221; Hollande is quoted as saying in the book published this week.&#8221;It&#8217;s not that Islam poses a problem in the sense that it is a dangerous religion, but in as far as it wants to affirm itself as a religion of the Republic.&#8221;Hollande also told the Le Monde journalists Gerard David and Fabrice Lhomme: &#8221;I think there are too many arrivals of immigration that shouldn&#8217;t be there.&#8221;Immigration and national identity are key themes in campaigning for next year&#8217;s presidential election.A string of attacks in France in the past two years, coupled with the Europe-wide migrant crisis, have stoked anti-immigration sentiment.A heated debate about Muslim integration in staunchly secular France came to a head over the summer when about 30 towns banned the body-concealing burkini swimsuit. France&#8217;s highest administrative court later ruled that such a ban was a &#8220;serious&#8221; violation of basic freedoms.The deeply unpopular Hollande has not yet declared whether he intends to stand for re-election.But his arch-rival Nicolas Sarkozy, bidding for the centre-right nomination, is campaigning heavily on populist anti-immigration themes. &#8221;Politicians from across the spectrum have almost a free rein to criticise/demonise Islam and Muslims and use it as a scare tactic whenever a particular leader or political party is in a critical situation facing the public opinion &#8211; knowing that the French Muslim citizens have no real organised lobby with the capacity to exercise any influence on the parties or politicians,&#8221; French sociologist and media critic Ali Saad told Al Jazeera.&#8220;This reality is even clearer in the case of the present government, since all the Socialist Party&#8217;s tenors &#8211; such as [Prime Minister] Valls, [former finance minister] Macron, [and women's rights Minister Laurence] Rossignol &#8211; are on the same wavelength as the president,&#8221; he added.The French government&#8217;s policies &#8211; particularly in the wake of the 2015 Paris attacks and the subsequent declaration of a state of emergency &#8211; have come under harsh criticism from rights groups for the targeting of Muslims through detainment and harassment.&#8220;In the long term, such a stigma endured by Muslim citizens would force them into seclusion, which could entail grave consequences for France&#8217;s social cohesion because isolation helps religious extremism to take roots and develop,&#8221; said Saad.Asked about Hollande&#8217;s comments, government spokesman Stephane Le Foll reiterated the president&#8217;s remarks.&#8220;There&#8217;s a problem with Islam today because Islam is politicised by some. There is a problem &#8211; and at the same time we need to be able to overcome this problem.&#8221; &#8211; Al Jazeera/Agencies
