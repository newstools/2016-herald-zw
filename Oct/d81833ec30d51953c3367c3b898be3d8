Nqobile Tshili Bulawayo BureauWelfare Services for War Veterans, War Collaborators and Ex-Political Detainees Minister Retired Colonel Tshinga Dube has queried the number of registered freedom fighters, saying it has remained static even though a number of them have died over the years. Rtd Col Dube told Bulawayo journalists last Friday that ex-freedom fighters figures could be much lower. We ve 34 000 registered war veterans, but with the way they are dying at a very fast pace and old age, it s difficult to ascertain their numbers. We also have 5 000 detainees and restrictees, said Rtd Col Dube.He said his ministry was struggling to register war collaborators as the verification process was proving to be difficult.Rtd Col Dube said he was not in a position to reveal the amount of money the Government was spending on war veterans allowances each month as it varies per individual.He said war veterans allowances depended on the extent of injuries suffered during the country s war of independence. I can t tell you how much each one gets from the war veterans pension. It depends on the percentage of incapacitation. Some were five percent others 20 percent and others lost all their legs they are given about 80 percent, he said.
