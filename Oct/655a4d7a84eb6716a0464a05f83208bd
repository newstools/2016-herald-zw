Lifestyle WriterBorrowdale Racecourse will be a haven of activity and fun today when it hosts the 2016 edition of the Summer Bounce Burnouts which is expected to feature well known spinners from Zimbabwe and South Africa. The high octane and stunt-filled event is expected to feature 15-year-old female spinner, Kaylin, who hails from the South African diamond capital Kimberley.This will be Kaylin s debut performance in Harare where she will be joined by local greats such as Fat Cat of Team Fat Cat, Goofa from the Snap on Stunt Masters camp and Spin Kid from the New Boyz Spin City stable.Since its introduction in Zimbabwe six years ago through the pioneering efforts of Fact Cat, Goofa and Alistair, spinning has been perceived as a male dominated sport thus Kaylin s performance will be eagerly awaited.Event organiser Fat Cat said the Kaylin s performance is aimed at inspiring other women to take up the sport and to demonstrate that women can be as good as their male counterparts in the spinning arena.Borrowdale Racecourse has been the ceremonial home of spinning events which usually feature the popular BMW 3 series Gusheshe model renowned for being one of the most stable vehicles ever engineered.Fat Cat said the entertainment package will take care of people from diverse backgrounds including kids adding that there will be many kinds of beverages and meals to please the palate. This is a family event and we are urging people to come out in full force. There will be lots of entertainment for everyone and as usual, we will have top drawer performances from spinners, said Fat Cat.The spinning stunts usually involve drivers jumping in and out of moving vehicles at amazing speeds while they also hang on precariously to swirling cars.Organisers said today s event will start at 10am and will run up to about 8pm.
