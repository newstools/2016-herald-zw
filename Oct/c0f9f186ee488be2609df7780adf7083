Naledi Sande: Cool Lifestyle ReporterThe second edition of the Zimbabwe Mbira Festival was held last week at Prince Edward School and the overall winner s floating trophy was formally handed over to its recipients St. Martin s Convent Primary School by the chairman of the Zimbabwe Mbira Festival Dr Aggripa Sora accompanied by the festival s director Mr Albert Chimedza. This was the first time the festival has introduced a trophy in a competitive category. Festival director, Mr Chimedza said it is significant that primary school pupils beat secondary schools and colleges in winning this trophy as it assures that their cultural heritage is secure.He said, This assures us that if we invest in the introduction of traditional instruments, sports and games in our school curriculum and activities calendars, the future of these aspects of our cultural heritage will be very secure. Another significant thing is that they were celebrating a mission school winning an mbira trophy and that has its pupils actively engaged in mbira and traditional games activities.Mr Chimedza added, I hope this indicates the future relationship between the churches and our traditional culture since it was the missionaries who, over a century ago, demonised our culture and our musical instruments, particularly the mbira. The Zimbabwe Mbira Festival is the flagship event during Mbira Month inaugurated five years ago which is celebrated in September with a purpose of creating a greater awareness and appreciation of mbira.The festival s main objective is to nurture and cultivate mbira interest in the young through our educational institutions.
