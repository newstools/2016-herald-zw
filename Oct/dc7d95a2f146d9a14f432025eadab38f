Washington ArubiJOHANNESBURG. One of South African football s minnows, Alexandra Black Aces, have completed the signing of Washington Arubi. The Zimbabwe international goalkeeper has joined the club as a free agent, having parted ways with the University of Pretoria at the end of last season. Aces already have the likes of former Orlando Pirates trio Rudolf Bester, Clifford Ngobeni and Dennis Masina on their books.However, results on the field have continued to elude coach Steve Barker and the team. The team has lost three consecutive games in their league campaign. The team also lost against Baberwa FC in the preliminary round of the Nedbank Cup.Barker and his team have so far earned their points when they were awarded a walkover against Garankuwa United in their first ABC Motsepe league game, due to insufficient players registration cards. Aces are in 12th place in the South African third tier with three points in four games. Soccerladuma.
