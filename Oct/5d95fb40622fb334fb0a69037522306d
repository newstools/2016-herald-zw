The Fun Cargo, which had eight passengers on board, dislodged a right front lower ball joint, resulting in the driver losing control and encroaching into the lane of the oncoming Voxy.Five of the deceased were in the Fun Cargo, while the remainder were in the Voxy. Police attributed the accident to a mechanical fault. The injured were ferried to Chegutu District Hospital and two of them were transferred to Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals in Harare for further treatment.
