KUALA LUMPUR. Justin Thomas secured a back-to-back CIMB Classic golf title yesterday, posting a flawless eight-under 64 to erase a four-stroke overnight deficit in the only PGA tour event he has ever won. Thomas finished at 23-under overall at TPC Kuala Lumpur, three shots ahead of Japan s Hideki Matsuyama, whose final-round 66 was not enough to keep up.Both of the 23-year-old Thomas s two PGA Tour wins have been at the CIMB Classic. Thomas also put in a solid showing at last week s Safeway Open, the PGA Tour s season-opener, finishing just four strokes off the lead. I feel like I just need to continue to build on this momentum and try to use this as kind of a springboard to the start of the year, he said. AFP.&nbsp;
