Clothes mean nothing until someone lives in them . . . Phillip Macherenje affectionately known as MC Phil is one good example of a master of ceremony who knows how to play in the fashion lane. These days it is all about colour co-ordination and some men are not afraid to try the trendyTafadzwa Zimoyo: Fashion Talk 263You can never be overdressed or over-educated.What a tremendous feedback last weekend over what has been deemed watch out for fashion police by many. Let me set the record straight to some of my colleagues who think I was wrong by attacking a fellow journo. By the way, this is a fashion column and my job is to enlighten readers about trends, highlight the dos and don ts, give guideline on the fashion express closet and work with style gurus for the betterment of fashion industry. Fashion journalism is an art and I must say, we should wake up and smell the coffee before it is too late. Let s not praise others while we can do better and get the same praise.We so love other shows on DSTV, but we criticise our national television, if somehow they are lacking when it comes to fashion and styling, why not give a hand like what this column did last week.We are not even apologetic about attacking him, but as fashion police our message was heard and we are happy.Anyway back to closet issue, try to dress within your means.So again another email came asking how should master of ceremonies at wedding should dress.For dressing, it depends on the occasion, you are emceeing.The bottom line at a wedding, be formally dressed in a suit.If you are performing at a concert, mostly jeans and a T-shirt make the trick because you need to be comfortable and flexible.Things have changed now and men should avoid overly tight clothes whether formal or casual wear.Not only do they look unmanly, they are also uncomfortable to move around.Have you seen guys in very tight suits?They can barely lift up their hands.Men s clothes are supposed to be free. It is not good when clothes are too tight, doctors suggest that. People who do this are mostly trying to copy trends they see on television but be guided, its scripted and it is for stage.Ok ladies, let s get into formation again, we hear that you are abusing the new trendy neck-piece choker .By the way you are choking the fashion industry.You should know that choker does not mean choke-her , because that fashionable and malleable material stretched thin across our necks does not insinuate anything.There is so much constant pressure on women to look good in whatever they wear, at all times.But now something as measly as a choker is grabbing an unwarranted kind of attention.For the record a choker is a style of necklace.It can be made of metal, beads, leather and just about any other malleable material.As to what it means when a girl chooses to wear one, it means they like the style, or perhaps received it as a gift and want to please the giver by wearing it. It has nothing to do with their sexual orientation, favourite kink, or occupation.Back to the order of the week, it is on colour combination and especially with men. We have noticed that if you are too colourful it becomes a problem.Colour combination is really an important part when it comes to making a first impression, because it confers a personal touch.Through colours, you communicate more about yourself and most people process colour interpretation faster than other aspects of your look.It is a very refined way of communicating information about you.Nevertheless, it should always come down to your personal judgment, and how you look at colours.For the record, a choker is a style of necklace. It can be made of metal, beads, leather and just about any other malleable materialIt is hard to give an exact answer to this question, but in general one can say that the risk of using too many colours is greater than the risk of using too few.Too many colours will make you look hard on the eye, as there is a crowd of colours demanding for attention, so it is really tiring to the eyes.On the other hand, wearing just a few colours, makes you look boring, but this does not always need to be the case.Colour has slowly evolved in importance for menswear, becoming increasingly important for a market that places such emphasis on elevated and updated basics.For summer-spring 2016 season, the dominant palettes on fashion snoops radar all confirm various themes that place a renewed focus on contemporary sport, archetypes of men s uniforms, and plenty of luxe classics that can translate to cityscapes, island getaways, or country scenes.Make sure the colour fits and is in place.Gone are the days of wearing shiny or dull coloured suits. These days too both women and men is all about the lapel and colour.&nbsp;Facebook: tafadzwa zimoyo thebosstwitter: tafadzwa zimoyoinstagram: tafadzwa zimoyo the bosssnapchat: tafadzwa zimoyoemail [email&#160;protected]
