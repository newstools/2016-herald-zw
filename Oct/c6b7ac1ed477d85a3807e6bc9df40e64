SYDNEY. The Australian para-cyclist of the year says the medals were taken from her car parked outside the Victorian Institute of Sport in Melbourne early yesterday after thieves smashed through a window. Cooke had been showing off the medals at various promotional events. The medals are medals. They re not the end of the world, Cooke said. But I share those medals with everybody I speak too, especially school kids. I m not one of these athletes that puts them away. I take them with me and pass them around. The 55-year-old took gold in the women s T1-2 road race in Rio a month ago and also defended her London 2012 crown in the 15km T1-2 road time trial. The Canadian-born former undercover police officer was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1998 and has been in a wheelchair since 2001. I m just gutted that they re gone, she said. They re priceless. AFP.
