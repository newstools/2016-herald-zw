SHANGHAI. Novak Djokovic returns from injury at this week s Shanghai Masters with the eyes of the tennis world on his form and motivation as his world number one spot comes under threat from Andy Murray. The Serb has been a peerless performer in China, and when he won his third Shanghai Masters title last year he was putting the finishing touches on one of the best tennis seasons in history. But since completing a career Grand Slam at the French Open in June, it has been a troubled period for the 12-time major winner who admitted he had lost his love for the game.Djokovic fell in Wimbledon s third round and, tearfully, in the first round at the Rio Olympics, before going down to his bete noire Stan Wawrinka in the US Open final.The Serb, who has spoken of private issues , quit his usual residence in Monte Carlo to return to his native Belgrade, revealing that he wasn t very well at an emotional level . I neither want to think nor to talk about the number one position, nor to win tournaments or Grand Slams, Djokovic told reporters in the Serbian capital. AFP.
