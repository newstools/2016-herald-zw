SINGAPORE. Angelique Kerber is the world number one in women s tennis, yet it remains a title she has yet to grow accustomed to after her meteoric rise to the summit. Still a relatively new experience, the 28-year-old German reached the peak of the women s game last month after landing her second Grand Slam title of the year at the US Open, capping a stunning season for the left-hander from Bremen.Kerber floated around the lower echelons of the top 10 for the last four years and did not even make the second week of a grand slam in 2015, but it all clicked in January.A run to the final in Brisbane preceded a surprise upset win over Serena Williams to land the Australian Open title as the baseliner renowned for her strong defensive game finally realised her talent. All the experience from the last few years came together this year. The belief in myself, I ve grown up a little bit more this year, she told Reuters of her new-found maturity. Reuters.
