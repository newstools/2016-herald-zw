Tedious Manyepo: Sports ReporterHIGHLANDERS coach Erol Akbay believes his team s Chibuku Cup exit will enable them to fully focus on chasing the league title. Bosso were eliminated from the country s biggest knock-out tournament in the semi-finals by top-flight rookies Ngezi Platinum at Barbourfields. Now that we are out of the Chibuku Cup, we have to focus on winning the league title. We would have wanted to win the double, but we came short against Ngezi Platinum in the Chibuku Cup. They played good football and we also tried our best, but it was not our day. But that means we should win the league title at all costs as we no longer have to worry about the Chibuku tournament. His charges will have to be at their best for their dream to come true as they host unpredictable Tsholotsho on Saturday. Tsholotsho coach Lizwe Sweswe said he was looking for nothing, but victory. We already know that Bosso are desperate to win against us this Saturday. But then we need the points more than them because we have to survive relegation, said Sweswe.
