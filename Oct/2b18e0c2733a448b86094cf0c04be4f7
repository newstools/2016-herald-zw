Sports Reporter HARARE Athletics Board secretary-general Silas Muringani says they are gearing up for the inaugural PPC 42km marathon on Sunday. The race will start at the PPC Msasa depot and end at Old Hararians Sports Club. There is also a 21km and a 5km race. Muringani said they were expecting the country s top athletes for the race as most of them prepare for qualifying events for the World Championships next year. Right now athletes are eyeing to qualify for the World Athletics Championships in London next year. So it s time for them to qualify but they will need to test themselves before they go out for approved events and see where they are. It also gives them some practice time for the events since it s a 42km event, so that at least they know where they are standing, said Muringani. Some of the athletes expected to take part are Cuthbert Nyasango, Wirimai Juwawo, who recently won the Westgate half marathon, Olivia Chitate and Jonathan ChinyokaThe race is coming just a few days after the Westgate half marathon and Muringani said they are grateful to the sponsors for coming on board. We want to thank PPC for having faith in the National Athletics Association of Zimbabwe by investing in another race, this 42km race. They already sponsor the Matopos 33 Miler marathon. So they are coming up with another race in Harare. We also want to thank them in these economic hard times, they are providing for the athletes, said Muringani. The HAB secretary-general said they are meeting with the sponsors today to finalise the logistics for the race.
