My video is being played on TBN. I am receiving airplay in countries like Ghana, Nigeria, SA and Tanzania. Usacheme is a relevant song to people going through difficult times either those who have lost their loved ones or someone going through misfortunes, he said.Mahachi said many gospel lovers will find it relevant as they go through the economic challenges they were facing. The song is one of those that give solution to societal problems by bringing people closer to God. It is timely because it speaks directly to the challenges people are facing because of the prevailing situation. People have a lot of questions but only God brings hope, he added.In the video there is a girl who has lost hope and decides to commit suicide. When she was about to commit the act, God spoke to her through prayer.He urged people to support local musicians. Let us celebrate our musicians here before they shine outside. I am surprised to note that when you go outside the country to perform or for a tour, you are treated differently than when you are home. Outside you are a star but ignored back at home and not given much respect of an artistes. Music is not only for entertainment but business-wise hence should be taken seriously as it sustain livelihoods, he elaborated.
