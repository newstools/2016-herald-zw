(1)2 Harare City&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; (0)1 Harare City learnt the hard way that you can only win games when you convert your chances after they fell to hosts Hwange in an exciting Castle Lager Premier League soccer match played under simmering temperatures at the Colliery yesterday. The Moses Bambo Chunga-coached Harare City outfit started the match on a blistering pace with their attacks revolving around speed merchant Martin Vengesayi and pint-sized Tatenda Tumba, but they fluffed a glut of scoring opportunities that came their way, especially in the opening half.Just two minutes into the match, Vengesayi beat Hwange defender David Boriwondo for pace on the right flank and laid a sitter for Raphael Manuvire, who shot tamely off target with goalkeeper Tymon Mvula to beat.Hwange s slippery Gift Mbweti thought he had got the breakthrough for his team three minutes later when he hit the nets from a goalmouth scramble, but his effort was ruled out by referee Martin Chivandire after first assistant referee Brilliant Sibanda rightly spotted an infringement by Gilbert Zulu on goalkeeper Maxwell Nyamupanendengu in the build up to the goal.The visitors then camped in the Hwange half with William Manondo denied from close range by enterprising Hwange goalkeeper Mvula in the 10th minute as the Sunshine Boys continued with their early dominance.The coalminers then almost raced into the lead against the run of play in the 25th minute after Mvula s long clearance was cleverly flicked by Zulu into the path of an on-rushing Pritchard Mpelele whose first time ferocious volley beat Nyamupanedengu all systems out only for the effort to scrap some paint off the left upright and out of play for a goal-kick.Ten minutes later there was no denying young Mpelele when he majestically rose to connect a well taken Phakamani Dube free-kick into the roof of the nets to leave Nyamupanedengu clutching thin air.Hwange started the last half in a no-nonsense mood and could have banged in three goals in a space of 15 minutes had they been more precise in front of goal. The first culprit was Oscar Lungu in the 50th minute as he completely missed the ball with a yawning net in front of him after he had come connected with a delicate Farai Vimisai cross.Vimisai was not done as moments later he embarked on another mazy run on the right with another trademark cross that connected with a glancing Zulu header which found Nyamupanedengu alert in between the sticks for the visitors.On the hour mark the visitors again rode on their luck as overlapping Phakamani Dube unleashed a rasping volley from the edge of the box which crashed on the underside of the crossbar and bounced on the goal line before defender Arnold Chivheya scooped the ball to safety. The coalminers then doubled their advantage in the 65th minute when Boriwondo headed home a Vimisai corner.Hwange celebrations were, however, short-lived as referee Chivandire awarded what looked like a harsh penalty to the visitors after their swift counter attack saw Vengesayi breaking loose in the box forcing goalkeeper Mvula to dive and scoop the ball from his feet to safety, but the referee stunned the Hwange players and fans by pointing to the spot.And up stepped Manuvire to send Mvula the wrong way to ensure Hwange had to defend for dear life up to the final whistle as the visitors threatened to force a share of the spoils. Hwange coach Mebelo Njekwa was a happy man after the match. I am very happy because we are improving by the match as we aim for a strong finish at the end of the season. We look forward to the next encounter, he said. Harare City coach Chunga blasted his players for approaching the match in a poor mental state. Firstly, I would like to congratulate the referees for a job well done today. My players approached the match lightly as perhaps they are more focused on the upcoming Chibuku Super Cup semi-final match, which is wrong in football as every match is important, said Chunga.Teams: Hwange: T Mvula; P Dube; O Moyo; D Boriwondo; M Mungadze; A Tshuma; F Vimisai(J Kaunda 85th min); P Mpelele; O Lungu; G Zulu; G MbwetiHarare City: M Nyamupanedengu; T Chimwemwe; A Chivheya; J Jam (S Muneka 85th minute); E Madhananga; W Manondo; R Manuvire; D Mawere(G Kufandada 46th minute); T Tumba (J Chipangura 75th minute); R Uchena; M Vengesayi.
