For that alone I have every reason to thank God, he said. A section of music lovers felt betrayed when he joined UFIC church as a pastor but the Mugove hit-maker said he was simply serving God. There was noise with some people castigating me for that move, there is nothing wrong in me joining a church because I am simply serving the interests of my Creator, he said.He said gone were the days when musicians banked on sales but they now need to employ good marketing strategies to be viable.

Two years ago Zhakata released an album Zvangu Zvaita that did not make an impact on the local scene. However, his loyal fans voted song Dhonza Makomborero it to be Radio Zimbabwe Coca Cola s best song.
