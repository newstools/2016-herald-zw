RADAR Today, Saturday, the 22nd is a day of reckoning for zanu-pf, as the ruling party. A day which marks, the noisiest campaign coming from southwest of Harare in a constituency called Norton. In the same direction, zanu-pf and, indeed, the whole of Zimbabwe, turns in the same direction, where the sun is setting for one of Zimbabwe s gallant sons, national hero Cde Cephas George Msipa.HERO . . . The late Cde MsipaA true gallant son of the soil, Cde Msipa will be buried at the sacred shrine with many cadres and patriots turning a keen ear to the Norton by-election.The late political darling of the Midlands province and a former Politburo member fought a good fight and he finally rests among his peers.One notable occurrence, however, is the way his burial, would, presumably, take with it the lies perpetrated by our colleagues from the other side.The burial puts to rest an unfortunate agenda peddled by those who just did not want the good man to rest peacefully after such a long journey.The so-called independent media, demagogues of lies, those trying to push a divisive agenda tried by all means to turn Cde Msipa s death into controversy.We are, however, worried that all effort is put on trying to be the spoilers in a period when we are supposed to be grieving as a nation.What s the point of pushing such an agenda when the whole nation is in mourning? Shame on them!Why would they suddenly want to be the Msipa family spokesperson?It is true when they say do not trust every word you read, especially if it is coming from characters who seek to prop up their journalistic profile by writing of political dynamics in which they have marginal comprehension.We were talking of the other event.The Norton by-election is here and our country s political destitute, Temba Mliswa, faces another humiliation.This, as you will agree with me, should not come as a surprise considering how he last fared in similar circumstances.Rejected by his own people in Hurungwe East, Mliswa decided to try his luck in Norton.Villain . . .Temba MliswaHe aims to slay the GIANT, the giant in zanu-pf. Ho!I pity those who have wasted time to listen to his shallow campaign; the man rarely utters a word of substance ever since his ruling party exit.A beneficiary of the revolutionary party s sound policies, failed to improve his thinking over the years.Temba had the opportunity to learn from the best brains in local politics within the zanu-pf ranks. Like any other meaningful organisation, zanu-pf had to let go of deadwood and this election will justify it decision.Today, is an easy day for the Norton residents, choosing between three candidates; an empty vessel who moans with every half chance awarded, an unknown farmer and an idealist who has exhibited undoubted potential in turning the prospects of Norton residents, something Mutsvangwa dismally failed to do?The unknown farmer is one David Choga of the National Constitutional Assembly, at least the Meteorological Services Department has predicted good rains and he has something more realistic to be excited about because this by-election is beyond his reach.The political crybaby is none other than Temba Mliswa, for a man whose name translated to hope , we have to marvel at the irony life presented on this hopeless character.Ronald Chindedza will easily bag this one; he has exhibited aptitude in the run-up to this by-election.Understanding that people need shelter, he has facilitated residential stands for the people in the constituency.Unfortunately, there is no prize for guessing what he will do once elected in office.If Chindedza follows the precedent being set by other competent zanu-pf, the future of the Norton residents is in good hands.zanu-pf is the party, a party with a history of leaving everything they touch with traces of gold.It is, however, worrying that Mliswa thinks so lowly of the Norton constituency.How dare he try to salvage his waning political prospects with the plight of people?Desperation can push a man to do anything, even the unthinkable and this man s actions are true testament to the saying.Had a vacant political seat emerged in Magwegwe, he was going to vie for the seat without shame, a crook is with no shame, and it is true.His life is laminated with deafening ironies though; the thinking behind his new Bhuru moniker, considering his current political weakness defies logic.Politics is not for everyone.On a parting note, the poltical scientist-turned-robbing-hood is hiding somewhere.Has he not found directions to the ZACC offices up to now?The principle of good governance puts emphasis on transparency, not on Twitter, but real life accountability.As educated and experienced as he is, we expect him to simply provide the answers to the questions raised and put the issue to rest.In all honesty, the longer this case drags on, the more inconvenient it is to the nation and his Twitter followers, the tribalism rhetoric will end in the annoyance of both parties.Back to the events of the day, political reincarnation is at play as we pay our last respects to Cde Msipa and Cde Chindedza puts Mliswa in his rightful place, in a cache with other political nonentities.Sincerely hoping that Mr Choga of the NCA has already signed up for Command Agriculture.And may the good comrade Msipa ascend well to the afterlife.
