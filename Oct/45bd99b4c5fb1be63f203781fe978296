Sports ReporterWORLD football governing body FIFA have rejected calls for the appointment of either an interim or normalisation committee to run Zimbabwe football in a massive vote of confidence in the ZIFA leadership led by Harare property mogul Philip Chiyangwa. The calls were made by some disgruntled football officials and former ZIFA workers at a meeting held with FIFA representative Ashford Mamelodi in Harare last month.FIFA have also in their report ignored a letter written by losing ZIFA presidential candidate, Trevor Carelse-Juul, who claimed Chiyangwa allegedly bought votes to secure the ZIFA presidency.Carelse-Juul, who is based in South Africa, made the claims after losing his second straight bid for the ZIFA leadership.FIFA, in their report, said the biggest challenge facing Zimbabwe football today was the ZIFA debt, estimated at around $7 million and urged ZIFA to find ways of liquidating the debt working in conjunction with the Government.FIFA also directed that elections for women s football, which was praised by the world football governing body for showing a lot of potential, should be done before the end of the year. Following a recent mission to ZIFA by the FIFA Development Officer, Ashford Mamelodi and internal discussion on the mission report, we would like to formally inform you of the findings, FIFA director of member associations, Veron Mosengo-Oumba, said in his report that was sent to ZIFA president Chiyangwa. Mr Mamelodi held meetings with ZIFA personnel and football stakeholders. We thank you for facilitating these important discussions. The position of FIFA on the various matters raised is as follows:(1) Although there was a strong call for a normalisation process at ZIFA (including a call to put in place an interim leadership by some stakeholders, it is the current view of FIFA that this would not necessarily add value and resolve the challenges facing ZIFA.It is the position of FIFA that the ZIFA debt, said to be sitting at about $7 million, is the single biggest challenge facing ZIFA. Some of the major problems that ZIFA has, including failure to pay staff and creditors stems from this situation. FIFA does not have a framework to assist with this debt.As such, we urge you to finalise your discussions with the Zimbabwean Government regarding their assistance in addressing the ZIFA debt.(2) Given the laudable milestones reached to date by ZIFA and the potential of women s football in Zimbabwe, we are of the view that a united structure should be put in place in accordance with the ZIFA Statutes.In this regard we direct that measures be taken to ensure that a more united, all-inclusive and legitimate ZIFA women s football structure be put in place on or before December 31, 2016.We understand through media reports that ZIFA plans to conduct elections for the ZIFA Women s Football Committee. We kindly ask that you formally notify Mr Mamelodi of your plans.(3) Numerous stakeholders, including some within ZIFA structures, raised concerns that the current membership of the ZIFA Referees Committee excludes some of the country s top referees instructors. In view of the fact that no reasons were advanced for such exclusion and the top referees instructors were part of the former committee, we urge ZIFA to investigate how the ZIFA Referees Committee can be better structured with competent persons. Please advise if the support of the FIFA Technical Development Division is required in this regard.(4) Your request to have a Governance Workshop for members of ZIFA has been approved.Please liaise with Mr Mamelodi who will facilitate this workshop. Please note that FIFA will only pay for the costs linked to Mr Mamelodi s participation (flights, allowance and accommodation).(5) Detailed information on a previously approved Goal Project has been communicated to ZIFA from FIFA. Please be reminded that a contract has to be signed before December 31, 2016, to avoid forfeiture of the approved funding. In the event you require any further guidance, please do not hesitate to contact Mr Mamelodi.(6) We urge ZIFA to support the successful roll-out of football technical development activities in Zimbabwe.The FIFA Technical Development Officer for your region is currently inducting the new ZIFA Technical Director and will assist in the rescheduling of any disrupted FIFA courses.It is our hope that ZIFA will continue to find means and ways of liquidating the ZIFA debt as this is the biggest threat to a well-structured and efficient ZIFA.The FIFA Development Office will be at your disposal where necessary in addressing this letter.
