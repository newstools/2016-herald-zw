Herald ReporterIndependent candidate Mr Themba Mliswa, has won the Norton constituency by-election, polling 8 927 votes against Zanu-PF s Cde Ronald Chindedza who garnered 6 129. Mr David Choga of the National Consultative Assembly got 89 votes. The seat fell vacant following the expulsion from Zanu-PF of Mr Christopher Mutsvangwa. Mr Mliswa said to win the seat, he maximised on the loopholes in Zanu-PF. I felt l was unfairly expelled from Zanu-PF, remember me saying l will be back and now l am back, he said. l am a rural person and l simply maximized on the in-house fighting in Zanu PF. How can l fail to win against a party whose political commissar (Cde Saviour Kasukuwere) is always firing people instead of recruiting? This is a message to Zanu PF that if you don t deal with your manifesto and concentrate on in-fighting people will speak out like they did in Norton. Cde Chindedza was not reachable on his phone
