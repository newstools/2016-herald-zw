Hillary ClintonWASHINGTON. Relations between the United States and Russia will deteriorate even more if US Democratic party presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is elected next US president, Ron Paul Institute for Peace and Prosperity Executive Director Daniel McAdams told Sputnik. If Hillary Clinton becomes President, I think relations with Russia from everything we ve seen, from what she says and from who her advisers are, I think it s 100 percent or 90 percent chance they will worsen at least in the short term, McAdams stated.McAdams explained that Clinton has been very aggressive toward Russia, including during the third presidential debate in Las Vegas on Wednesday. In the last presidential debate, she even accused Russian President (Vladimir) Putin of personally being involved to try to elect Donald Trump as president. It s an incredible accusation, and I think it will worsen relations, certainly in the short term, he said.McAdams noted, however, that with Republican nominee Donald Trump it is harder to predict what the US-Russia relations will look like if he is elected to be the next president of the United States. The problem with Trump is that you don t really know what his position is from day to day. He has said consistently, and in the last debate, why is it so bad if the United States and Russia get along? And that s something that Hillary camp will not accept, he said.McAdams went on to say that Trump is also very aggressive toward Russia s allies Iran and China.A poll by the Russian Public Opinion Research Centre revealed earlier this month that almost one-third of Russians, or 29 percent, think that Trump s victory in the November elections will lead to the improvement of US-Russia relations Sputnik News.
