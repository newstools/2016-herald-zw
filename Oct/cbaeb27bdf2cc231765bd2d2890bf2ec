Nyemudzai Kakore: Herald Correspondent The Senate Thematic Committee on Gender and Development has called on Government to intervene in children s homes following reports that caregivers were reportedly looting donated goodies at the expense of the intended beneficiaries. Presenting its first report on the status of children s homes, the committee called on the social welfare department to hold interviews with potential caregivers to check on their background and their characters to ensure that qualified people were given the jobs. The committee cited the case of Chirinda, where it was allegedly discovered that there was lack of supervision and shortage of food.Said Sen Annah Shiri: We now have caregivers who are coming not to help these youngsters, but will be asking themselves of benefits derived from such homes. That is why they do not appreciate the situation of these children. We have realised that in such homes, there is need for a balance of male and female workers because they will take care of the needs of these youngsters. We urge members of the social welfare to assist these children in acquiring birth certificates because whenever there are activities to be undertaken at those schools, the orphans cannot take part because they lack these documents.
