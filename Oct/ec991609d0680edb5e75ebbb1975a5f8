Hara felt his players did not give it their all and warned them against bringing the culture of player power to the club. It s a clear case of players not giving it their all. As Chicken Inn, we are not going to allow player power. Those who don t want to play for us are free to leave. We are Chicken Inn and will remain Chicken Inn, said Hara.Players said Hara invaded the dressing room after the match and bared his soul. He had the support of Guide (Goddard) and other guys, but he was very emotional, said one of the players.Chicken Inn were tactically superior in terms of their technical make-up, but their frontmen, led by Thomas Chimenya, were AWOL. City pulled out Emmanuel Mandiranga for Eddie Nkulungo and Trevor Ndlovu for the enterprising Welcome Ndiweni in the second half and that move paid dividends as they found the solitary goal through Sipho Ndlovu. We made a timed and tactical change which paid for us, said City s stand-in coach Try Ncube. Chicken Inn coach Rahman Gumbo gave credit to City, but felt his strikers never came to the party. Our strikers did not come to the party and that is where we lost it. I am so disappointed by the loss, said Gumbo. Meanwhile, suspended City coach Philani Ncube is set to return to work today. Although both City s chairman Jerry Sibanda and vice-chairman Zenzo Moyo, were not available for comment, a source said Beefy was due to return to work today. Beefy (Philani) starts work tomorrow (today). Get in touch with those who run things in council and they will give you the correct picture, said the source.
