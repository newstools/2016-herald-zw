Mr CornishTinashe Makichi: Motoring CorrespondentIn order to provide drivers with the tools to stay safe behind the wheel, and promote fuel-efficient driving techniques, Ford Motor Company has launched its Driving skills for Life, free hands on training programme in Zimbabwe. The programme was established in the United States in 2003 by the Ford Motor Company Fund, and has been progressively rolled out around the world. This year, Ford Motor Company Sub-Saharan Africa introduced the programme to several countries across the region, including Nigeria, Angola, Kenya and Uganda. We are delighted to be making Ford Driving Skills for Life available in Zimbabwe, in association with Ford dealer Duly Motors. Vehicle collisions are one of the leading causes of death in Africa, and we believe that driver education and training is the most effective means of addressing this critical issue, said general manager operations Bill Cornish.Ford Driving Skills for life features some of the newest and most innovative tools and techniques to teach drivers to become safer and more aware, thus enabling them to make sound decisions behind the wheel.Through theoretical training in a classroom environment, followed by hands-on driving instruction, participants gain valuable insight and experience in vehicle handling, hazard recognition, as well as speed and space management, all of which accounts for more than 60 percent of crashes.In addition, they learn the importance of safety belt use for all vehicle occupants.The curriculum also includes the special Drunk Driving Suit and Drunk Goggles, which emphasise the dangers of driving while impaired.Participants have the opportunity to wear these items to gain perspective on how being over the legal alcohol limit can slow movement, reduce coordination, blur vision and make tasks difficult. Additionally, the programme includes eco-friendly driving tips in order to reduce fuel consumption and minimise our impact on the environment. This is in line with Ford s development of fuel efficient engine technologies, such as our multiple award-winning Eco-Boost turbocharged petrol engines, and the sophisticated Duratorq TDCi diesel units, said Mr Cornish.The initial Train the Trainer sessions were conducted at Donnybrook Race Track in Harare by professional Ford Driving Skills for Life instructors from South Africa.Selected Duly Motors staff underwent extensive theoretical and practical training on all aspects of the course, and as accredited DSFL instructors, will continue the programme in Zimbabwe.Ford Motor Company is a global automotive and mobility company based in Dearborn, Michigan.
