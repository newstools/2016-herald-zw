Deputy Minister MbwembweBianca Leboho Herald Reporter Government has hailed the economic, political and social relations that exist between Zimbabwe and the Republic of Korea, with the two countries looking into further strengthening their ties. Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Edgar Mbwembwe said this at celebrations to mark the 4 348th Korean National Foundation Day in Harare on Thursday.The celebrations, which were held at the Korean ambassador s residence, were attended by senior Government officials, parliamentarians, captains of industry, members of the diplomatic corps, the Korean community in Zimbabwe, Harare Mayor Councillor Bernard Manyenyeni, and University of Zimbabwe students studying Korean language, among others.Deputy Minister Mbwembwe congratulated South Korea and hailed the bilateral relations that exist between the two countries. It is an honour to join South Korea in celebrating their 4 348th National Founding Day anniversary. Zimbabwe is satisfied with the broadening and deepening of bilateral relations with the Republic of South Korea, amply demonstrated by the extensive discussions held under the auspices of the two sessions of diplomatic consultations held so far between the two countries, said Deputy Minister Mbwembwe.He added that Government was looking forward to the implementation of all the agreed positions by the two countries.Deputy Minister Mbwembwe said it was important to note that the South Korean International Cooperation Agency (SKOICA) had continued to be instrumental in assisting Zimbabweans to access higher and tertiary education. South Korea has launched alumni of Zimbabweans who benefited from the generosity of the South Korean government and people, in the field of human resource development, he said.He said the South Korean government through the South Korea/Africa Food and Agricultural Cooperation Initiative (SKAFACI) had benefited Zimbabwe s agricultural sector, which played a pivotal role in the country s economic development. We are also aware that the South Korean Programme on International Agriculture (SKOPIA), opened a centre in Harare in 2015, which further extends our cooperation in the agricultural sector. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stands ready to extend all possible assistance for the sustainable operation of the centre, he said.He said despite the fact that the level of trade between the two countries stood at only $27 million, Zimbabwe was open to South Korean investors especially with the just concluded Ease of Doing Business policy, which would make it easier for foreign companies to set up shop in Zimbabwe.Republic of Korea s Ambassador to Zimbabwe, Mr Kwon Yong-kyu, said the blueprint for comprehensive cooperation with Africa announced by President Park Geun-hye during her tour of Africa early this year would serve as a solid framework within which the partnership and cooperation between South Korea and Zimbabwe could be broadened. Although bilateral trading relations between the two countries are still lagging behind, South Korea and Zimbabwe have been able to foster viable political and economic relations. South Korea was ranked third on the list of Asian countries that have the most tourists in Zimbabwe according to the Zimbabwean Ministry of Tourism and Hospitality information desk. The South Korean government also opened an agricultural centre in the country, with the hope that Zimbabwe will regain its former glory as the breadbasket of Africa, said Ambassador Kwon.He added that although both Zimbabwe and South Korea had glorious civilisations from the past, they both suffered from the sad history of colonialism and civil war, which was why South Korea was compassionate towards Zimba- bweans. We strongly believe that Zimbabwe can overcome its difficulties and materialise its great potential fully as we did in the past, said Ambassador Kwon.South Korea is home to the global electronic giant Samsung, which has set up a plant in Zimbabwe.
