BURNLEY. Arsene Wenger admitted Arsenal were lucky to come away with a narrow 1-0 victory over Burnley after a disputed injury-time winner took them within two points of the English Premier League soccer summit. Burnley were left frustrated after defender Laurent Koscielny scored from a corner deep into stoppage time, as the ball rebounded off his hand and over the line.Despite the controversial finish, a fifth consecutive league win moves Arsenal up to third, two points behind leaders Manchester City who surrendered their 100 percent start in a 2-0 defeat to second-placed Tottenham Hotspur. I was fuming because we played the short corner at the end of the two added minutes, said Wenger. I was asking why didn t we take the direct corner? I didn t see it go in, but I ve been told that we were fortunate to get the goal. Burnley manager Sean Dyche cut a frustrated figure after the defeat, which left his newly promoted side 14th in the table. AFP.
