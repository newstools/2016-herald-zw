DURBAN. The All Blacks record win over South Africa has been greeted with superlatives from rugby writers around the world as they marvel over Steve Hansen s side. Media outlets and specialist rugby sites around the globe lauded the All Blacks 57-15 triumph. Here are some of the accolades. The Sydney Morning Herald The two-time defending world champions completed the most dominant campaign of any team in the history of the SANZAAR competition, securing a bonus point in each of their six wins.Captain Kieran Read s brilliant team can own the record outright with victory over Australia in Auckland on October 22. On current form, that almost seems a formality such was the dominance in their biggest-ever win in 93 Tests against their most famous foe.Up 12-9 at half-time a scoreline which flattered the hosts New Zealand ran amok after the break, keeping the ball in hand relentlessly and finding holes through an attacking style which was audacious but remarkably error-free. The All Blacks showed no signs of any distraction from the midweek controversy surrounding Aaron Smith.Sunday Times Other than what looks to be a promising England side coached by Eddie Jones, only Allister Coetzee s men in the green and gold could have provided some sort of challenge in putting a stop to the Kiwis rampant run.While many who walked through the King s Park gate expressed their funny feeling of an upset in Durban in favour of the Boks, it was not to be.Some would describe the All Black team as similar to a fine wine that gets better, if anything, Hansen s side has often proven to be a well-oiled machine that gets the engine powering in the latter stages of the game.IOL, South Africa It would ve been painful to watch for Springbok supporters, but hopefully now coach Allister Coetzee will realise how far behind the All Blacks they are after being put to the sword by 57-15 in Durban on Saturday night.The Boks were all bluster, but the inherent attacking mindset of the All Blacks was just too hot to handle as the Kiwis scored nine tries to nought to set a new record winning margin of 42 over the South Africans surpassing the 52-16 win in 2003 and underline their dominance and finish the Rugby Championship unbeaten after six matches.The All Blacks have now equalled the world record of 17 consecutive Test wins by a tier-one nation, and will have a chance to set a new mark against Australia in Auckland on October 22.But on Saturday, while the Boks showed good abrasiveness and were certainly up for the game, they were never going to beat New Zealand with just a brute pack of forwards and Morn Steyn. But that s all that Allister Coetzee had in store, and they received a rugby lesson from Steve Hansen and his team.Johannesburg Citizen The final results was never in doubt from the time All Blacks right wing Israel Dagg for the first of six tries that went unanswered after 80 minutes of play. Had flyhalf Beauden Barrett had his kicking boots on, the All Blacks winning margin would have been far greater.Independent UK South Africa s scrambling defence that held off Australia last weekend was no match for the world champions who completed a clean sweep of six wins in this year s southern hemisphere championship.The result bettered the 52-16 away victory over the Springboks in 2003 and emphasised the All Blacks status as the best team in the world. If New Zealand were missing some rhythm in the opening period, they found it in the second as they decamped in the opposition half, launching wave after wave of attacks. They scored four tries in the final 10 minutes as South Africa were overwhelmed, having no answer to the rampant visitors.Belfast Telegraph The All Blacks preparations for this clash were undermined by an embarrassing revelation on Wednesday when Smith was suspended for one Test and sent home from South Africa after admitting he joined a woman in a public toilet last month.The incident occurred at Christchurch Airport, the day after the world champions beat the Springboks on September 17 to secure the Championship title with two rounds to spare.Despite the distraction, the world champions produced a prolific attacking display and denied their opponents a try in achieving their 17th successive win the record for the most victories in a row by a tier one nation a feat they have managed before in 1965-1969 and 2013-2014.
