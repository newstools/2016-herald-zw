MADRID. Argentina s pain is Barcelona s gain as Lionel Messi returns for the Spanish soccer champions when Deportivo la Coruna visit the Camp Nou today after being sidelined for three weeks with a groin injury. Messi missed Argentina s World Cup qualifiers against Peru and Paraguay as La Albiceleste s struggles without the five-time World Player of the Year continued, putting at risk their place at the 2018 World Cup.However, international breaks have traditionally caused Barca trouble too with lethargic performances on their return to La Liga action coming to be known as the FIFA virus. Barca boss Luis Enrique paid a heavy price for leaving Messi and Luis Suarez on the bench for a shock 2-1 home defeat to Alaves after September s international break. However, with a blockbuster Champions League clash against former Barca coach Pep Guardiola s Manchester City to come on Wednesday, Enrique could roll the dice with his selection once more.Messi is expected to be eased back into action as a second-half substitute. Meanwhile, Suarez could make way for Paco Alcacer having played twice for Uruguay in the past week. AFP.
