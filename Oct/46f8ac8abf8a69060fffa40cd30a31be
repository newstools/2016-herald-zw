Professor MavhimaLovemore Meya Herald CorrespondentThe Deputy Minister of Primary and Secondary Education, Professor Paul Mavima, has lauded the Zimbabwe Rural Schools Trust (ZRST) for its continued support to Government by sourcing reading materials for peri-urban schools. The 10 000 books sourced by the trust are set to benefit 25 schools and were recently shipped from New Zealand by The Rock International Ministries.Speaking at the official handover of the books to various representatives from different schools in the country at the ministry s offices on Tuesday, Deputy Minister Mavima said the trust had embarked on a noble exercise. It is encouraging to note that there are still some Zimbabweans who are out of the country making such a great effort to support their home country, he said. I have been privileged to having participated at some earlier events by the ZRST, and I am encouraged that despite the challenges they face, the group is determined to bring about a better life for Zimbabwe s rural school population. Most pleasing for me is that the recipients of the books involved today are, with the exception of one peri-urban school, all rural schools. He said 70 percent of the school children were failing English, Mathematics and Science at Ordinary Level. The main reason for the failure rate is under-resourcing, which affects the public rural schools more than mission-run schools and urban schools. Government is making a lot of effort to address this situation, hence the donation of books from New Zealand could not have come at a better time. The Rock International has demonstrated that the role of the church is not only about converting people to the Lord, but also to empower the young so that they grow up to be informed individuals who can help not only themselves and their families, but the country as a whole, he said.
