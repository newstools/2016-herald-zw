Harare magistrate Ms Nomsa Sabarauta ordered Chideme to pay a fine of $150 with an option of three months in prison for driving without a driver s licence.In passing sentence, Ms Sabarauta said she considered that Chideme is a first offender, who pleaded guilty showing contrition. He is a family man and bread winner, therefore incarcerating him would be a harsh sentence, she said. However, people who drive without a valid driver s licence should be accountable. Driving without (a) valid driver s licence is leading to many road carnages. In this offence, the accused was travelling at high speed, an indication of negligence. At all times, celebrities should strive to abide by the law.
