Lupita Nyong oLONDON. Ever since Lupita Nyong o rose to stardom in Hollywood, she s been equally lauded for her beauty and innate sense of style as she has been her acting skills. And the Oscar-winning actress, 33, continued to show that she can effortlessly reign supreme on the red carpet as she attended the BFI London Film Festival premi re of her new movie Queen of Katwe on Sunday night.The Mexican-born, Kenyan-raised beauty wowed as she hit the red carpet wearing a multi-coloured head wrap as she gave a stylish nod to her African homeland.Her expertly-tied wrap was paired with a matching sleeveless top, with tied spaghetti straps, giving her the opportunity to show off her enviably taut frame.She added another striking touch to her stunning ensemble of choice with a pair of powder blue high-waisted trousers, which were cuffed in high turn-ups but still completely obscured her open-toe platform heels.Earrings fell to just above her shoulders in a collection of increasing blue globes, framing her pretty face, which was made up with blue eye-liner and bold red lipstick.Aside from a dazzling ring, the Yale-educated beauty opted to forgo accessories, letting her head-turning outfit and glowing skin do all of the talking.She was joined on the red carpet by her co-star David Oyelowo, who cut a dapper figure in a green three-piece suit, as well as the film s director Mira Nair, who looked stunning in a black ensemble.In the movie, which was released in the US last month, Lupita plays the single mother of a Ugandan girl whose world is transformed after being introduced to the game of chess.The film is based on a magazine article and book by sports journalist Tim Crothers.In a recent interview while prompting the project, Lupita revealed that just a few pages into reading the script, she broke down and said she had to do the movie.She said during her visit to Good Morning America: On the pages I found interesting, real, complex, inspiring characters. And I could tell that in less than 10 pages and I just knew I had to be a part of this film. She added: It was such a rewarding labour of love to do this film, to get to tell this true, inspiring story in Uganda, in East Africa, where I m from. And to do it with Mira Nair, a woman of colour, who has lived there over 20 years, who knows the place and really told the story from inside out. &#8211; Dailymail.
