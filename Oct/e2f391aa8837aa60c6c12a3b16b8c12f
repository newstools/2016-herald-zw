We are actually surprised by the way our fans have responded to our new video album. We were under pressure to release it earlier but we wanted to do quality production, better than we did on the previous DVDs. We are launching it in Botswana because of our regionally based theme. Preparations are at an advanced stage as everyone has confirmed and everything is now in place, he said.The DVDs were produced by Norton-based videographer Itai Chatambira.Chivaviro said the demand in Africa for gospel music was amazing. The new fans-oriented version of Ebenezer is proving very popular with South Africans, Mozambicans and Batswanas. We shot some of the video scenes in those countries. We want to take that song across the continent, he said.Last month Chivaviro launched two books and a DVD album at New Creation Life Ministries in Bulawayo.The books launched are Unlimited Grace and Interpreting Your Dreams which he said were written to inspire the people.The musician has done collaborations with some great gospel singers who include Charles Charamba, Mechanic Manyeruke, Kudzi Nyakudya, Bethan Pasinawako, Rumbi Zvirikuzhe and Noel Zembe.
