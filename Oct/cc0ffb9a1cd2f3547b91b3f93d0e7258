Lovemore Chimaliro CorrespondentIn the past decade-and-half, Zimbabwe has braved socio-economic attacks from the West through the illegal sanctions regime.With the unwarranted and illegal sanctions now proving futile, a new gimmick by the country s detractors such as the US and UK has been mooted to try and use local civil society organisations to front protests in the mistaken belief that they can bring about regime change.With these external nefarious attempts to cripple Zimbabwe, it is high time every right thinking Zimbabwean, especially the youths, started interrogating some of their involvement in pushing external agendas at the expense of the national interest.By now, any well meaning citizen of this country should have seen the West s hand in the violent protests especially by the youths that rocked our country in recent months and their consequences.In pushing Western agenda, destroying infrastructure and hurting all efforts to make this country tick, the youths tend to forget that the future of this country is in their hands.Our liberation fighters, President Mugabe and his administration have done their part and laid the foundation on how a nation should be run especially under Africanism and youths must pick the gauntlet and safeguard this legacy.It will be worthwhile to call to mind that in Libya, that rich country that saw resources being plundered, oil being looted and the economy destroyed by a senseless war, people are confessing missing life under former leader Muammar Gaddafi.This is instructive to Zimbabweans.The country should continue to be guided by our collective national interest, fighting hard against foreign interference in our affairs.All right thinking Zimbabweans should remain keen and loyal to the national pledge, resisting all efforts by our detractors to destabilise the prevailing peace. The vision should be that of a people united for a national cause for the future of this country lies with the youth, the same group which our detractors are targeting by funding them to engage in street protests.This national vision can only be achieved if all Zimbabweans especially the youths as the future leaders of this beautiful nation lies in their hands.There should be an urge to build Zimbabwe and not to destroy it lest we would find ourselves ruing the day we danced to the western agenda tune, engaging in street protests and in the process hurting our economy like the Libyans.That constructive vision should start by recognising that all Zimbabweans, regardless of race, colour, religion or creed, are the owners and authors of their own destiny just like the Libyans were the authors of their destiny, but today they find themselves in a conundrum.It has to be asserted that unlike elsewhere Zimbabweans are rational and critical on everything, thanks to the Government s robust education policy.Zimbabweans are a more reasonable lot and might have already sensed the long term consequences of engaging in street protests hence the prevailing peace and calmness in our country today. The protests didn t even live up to their Western funders expectations as they were sporadic and contained.Government must continue to pursue this vigorous education policy so that Zimbabweans can effectively and efficiently compete in an age where knowledge is capital.Zimbabwe s ability in this regard needs no emphasis.Social media has of late been the medium of communication and has also been used to push their nefarious agenda.We must know that our detractors will not abandon their agenda anytime soon and will continue to explore other channels in their effort to destabilise the economy and hence the youths and every peace loving citizen should remain alert. But kudos to Zimbabwe s security forces, who have managed to contain sporadic protests that erupted in some parts of the country in recent months.Zimbabwe is at peace, but we should always know that these detractors are burning midnight candles, exploring other avenues in trying to destabilise everything that President Mugabe and his administration have laid for the people of Zimbabwe since 1980.The country prosperity is hinged on security, peace and stability with collective efforts and national interest the guiding principle, Zimbabwe will forever scupper any attempts by its detractors to cause mayhem.
