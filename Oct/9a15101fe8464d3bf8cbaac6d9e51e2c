Grace Chingoma Senior Sports Reporter CONTROVERSIAL women s soccer league board member Cecilia Gambe has been banned for two years from all football activities by ZIFA following her violent conduct against a referee during a top-flight match at Sakubva in May. Gambe was found guilty by the ZIFA Disciplinary Committee which sat this week to deliberate on her conduct after she invaded the pitch during a Premiership match between Mutare City and How Mine.Initially, the Committee which is chaired by Victor Matipano, slapped the administrator with a 10-year ban which was then reduced to two years. This means Gambe, who is the deputy chairperson of women s football interim committee which is holding fort until elections are held on November 19, ceases to be a member forthwith.That will leave chairperson Elizabeth Langa to go it alone until a new leadership is ushered next month. Gambe, who is based in Mutare, made a middle finger obscene gesture to Rusape referee Brighton Chimene who had shown a red card to Mutare City Derby Duri.She then invaded the pitch and made her situation worse in an interview she granted to our sister paper Manica Post that she was not on ZIFA business when she entered Sakubva.Gambe s prohibition will serve as a warning to other would be offenders as ZIFA battles to contain violence at football matches. Meanwhile, ZIFA have shortlisted three candidates for the general secretary position after the association s human resources committee held interviews yesterday.Black Leopards chief executive Kenneth Makhanya, former Dynamos treasurer Eric Mvududu and ZIFA Southern Region board member Brighton Malandule emerged as the top candidates according to sources.The trio have been recommended to ZIFA president Philip Chiyangwa and his board to decide on who will replace Jonathan Mashingaidze. The Swazi administrator Makhanya, who was interviewed through skype, is believed to have made the biggest impression, especially his PowerPoint presentation on his strategy to turn around ZIFA.He was also said to be the best qualified among the candidates. But sources said Mvududu is likely to get the job.
