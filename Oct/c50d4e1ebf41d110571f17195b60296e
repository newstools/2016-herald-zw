What is unlimited internet and what does it mean?Unlimited Internet means limitless internet usage without downloading caps. However, we are hasty to say that, since some users download so much data (like movies, games, and music) to the point that they affect the bandwidth of other subscribers, this prompts the Internet service provider to limit the internet speed of heavy users in order to distribute bandwidth fairly with other subscribers.ZOL Zimbabwe applies the same rules as all Internet service providers with the advantage that we have the most bandwidth available in the country.You should read the fine prints of your contract of subscription in order to ascertain that understand the fair usage policy.Many people find unlimited data plans very expensive, but if they had only tried to properly compare them with the limited offers and their needs, they would have understood what they would be missing out on.The first advantage is the unlimited network access, as the name suggests.There are times when we need to be connected 24 /7.If you are into online business, you will understand what I mean here.You don t want to run out of data and be offline when a million dollar contract is online and coming your way.Avoid such inconveniences by getting yourself an unlimited plan with ZOL Fibroniks.You also have the ability to do live streaming. If you want to prove how good this can be, buy a 30 MB data plan and open any streaming app, like Pandora.You will be surprised that the data plan that was supposed to last for a whole month runs down to 0.0 KB in just a few hours.If you are into video games, then unlimited ZOL Fibroniks packages are the way to go.Online games eat up a lot of data in a way that you cannot even explain. If you acquired the iPhone and purchase 100 MB data plan for it, it does not live to play the third game.With an unlimited data plan, unlike a limited one, you can play as many online games as you want.You also get more freedom. An unlimited data plan offers you freedom. There is no need to switch anything off, close that or uninstall the other.When using a limited data plan, make sure it takes you through the allocated time and you have to use it carefully.You have to make sure you close apps when you don t need them and turn off automatic updates and notifications.For someone who needs updates as soon as they happen, this can be bad. With an unlimited plan you do not need to worry about what apps are running or not.Endless downloads are another benefit of the unlimited plan. Downloading apps, video and audio files tends to take up a lot of data too, so if you know you will need to make some big downloads, buy unlimited ZOL Fibroniks packages.If you are on a limited package, though, and you do not want to reach your data caps, there are a few things you can do to avoid stress.First of all, ensure that you are registered to myZOL.co.zw where we will let you know how much data you have used.Secondly, use one a data tracker for Android or iOs to stay on top of your data with minimal fuss, and get notifications when you re getting close to your cap.Before considering what to purchase, always ensure you know your needs.
