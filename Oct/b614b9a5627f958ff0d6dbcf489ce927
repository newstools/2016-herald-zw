GonyetiNaledi Sande Arts Reporter &#8212; Songbird and dancer, Gonyeti, whose real name is Pamela Zulu, is set to launch her debut album titled One Day tonight at Dandaro Inn. The six-track album was produced at KBN Studios and has songs that include One Day , Bhande and Chioneone , which Gonyeti feels are the best. One Day is a good track and it is the first one I have introduced to the people so it is very familiar. However, listening to the whole album after recording, I feel Bhande and Chioneone are likely to surpass One Day in terms of popularity, said Gonyeti.Gonyeti is ecstatic about her progress as a solo artiste since she left Jah Prayzah s band and says the album is likely to create a new fan base. I was once a soldier and now I am a war vet so this is very pleasing to me as an artiste to have crossed that path and conquered the battlefield, she said.She was referring to her switch from Third Generation that is known as a group of soldiers to the brand war vet that she has assumed. Despite the cold war that followed her departure, Gonyeti says they are now in good books with Jah Prayzah.She has invited Jah Prayzah, Diana Samkange and Sulumani Chimbetu to be guest performers at the launch. For the sake of progress and business, we have decided to put our differences aside and let go of our past.
