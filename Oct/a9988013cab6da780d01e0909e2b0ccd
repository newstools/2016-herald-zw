ABU DHABI. Pakistan can ill-afford any complacency against a dangerous West Indies side when the two teams meet in the second Test cricket starting in Abu Dhabi from today. Normal service will be resumed with a traditional red ball and daylight play after both teams fought out a tension-packed pink ball day-night Test in Dubai, won by Pakistan by a narrow 56-run margin.Pakistan dominated the first three days after scoring 579-3 declared, courtesy of opener Azhar Ali s epic career best 302 not out, and then dismissing West Indies for 357.But leg-spinner Devendra Bishoo turned the match upside down with career best figures of 8-49 to wreck Pakistan for a paltry 123 in their second innings, giving West Indies a target of 346 to win. Darren Bravo batted out of his skin and when the last session started West Indies needed 114 runs in a possible of 38 overs with Bravo unbeaten on 102 and ready to launch an assault in the final hour.
