Business Editor IN recent months, prepaid electricity aggregation has risen to become a proven success story for Zimbabwe as the power utility has defied all odds associated with change and the implementation of new systems. In a period of two years since its establishment, the power utility has remarkably reached national prepaid electricity revenue collection of 95 percent through well-coordinated efforts by electricity vendors.The benefits of operating a prepaid electricity system are evident for all to see. One of the most noticeable has been the stabilisation of demand and supply of electricity nationally. The most interesting observation of late has been the much reduced load shedding and Government is applauded for ensuring the reliable supply of electricity.Since the appointment of Powertel as aggregator, the company has worked with other appointed vendors that include NetOne, ZB Bank, CBZ, Zimpost, GetCash, POSB, Homelink, Petrotrade with combined network of over 30 000 sub-vendors across the country, in order to establish and achieve wider distribution and access to convenient prepaid electricity to up platforms across the economic and social divide.The various channels for Powerplus include over the counter (OTC), point of sale (POS), mobile platforms, internet platforms, kiosks and ATM platforms. Powertel communications is an organisation which is responsible for the telecommunications infrastructure development, virtual private networking, high speed internet provision, the provision of the most affordable voice service, call centre facilities as well as prepaid electricity aggregation.Powertel is wholly owned by ZESA company established with the mandate of achieving telecommunication development for the nation and at the same time serving ZESA with technological solutions.The prepaid electricity solutions have had a positive impact on the Zimbabwean population in terms of accessibility and convenience.
