Johannesburg. Tempers flared when the families of 37 psychiatric patients who died while in the care of the Gauteng Department of Health, handed over a petition yesterday. Anger levels rose to match the 29 heat in the Johannesburg CBD as mothers, fathers, siblings and children of the patients demanded answers from department officials.The patients had been moved from Life Esidimeni Healthcare Centre to various NGOs around the province and subsequently died. They accused MEC Qedani Mahlangu of murder and vowed not to rest until justice was done. Qedani must go. Fire her now! they chanted.The group had gathered outside the department s office for a prayer vigil in remembrance of the patients. They had also planned to hand over a letter demanding action be taken and for people to be held accountable.The gathering began calmly. People held up posters and crosses representing those who had died. Family representatives and members of various civil and medical organisations took turns to share how they felt; the way the patients had been treated in the days leading up to cancellation of the department s contract with Life Esidimeni, and once the patients were moved out.
