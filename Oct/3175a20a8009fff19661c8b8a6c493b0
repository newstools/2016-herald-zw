LONDON. Alex Iwobi has spoken about a terrifying experience in which he was followed by an Arsenal fan on his way home from a game. The nephew of Bolton and Nigeria legend Jay-Jay Okocha, Iwobi has impressed for the Gunners after breaking into the first team last season, having joined the club when he was still in primary school.The pacy winger who has made seven appearances so far &#8211; spoke to Arsenal s weekly podcast and covered a range of topics, before moving on to the time he was trailed in his car. I remember the last home game we played. For 15 minutes there was one fan following me and I was getting a bit scared, he said. I was getting close to my destination. I was thinking, I m going to have to do a detour before I get to my destination before he ends up finding where I m going. That was a bit mad. Taking a break from being one of Arsenal s leading lights, Iwobi has transferred his form on to the international stage and opened the scoring in a 2-1 World Cup qualifying win against Zambia last weekend.
