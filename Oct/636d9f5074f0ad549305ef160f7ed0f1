Freeman Razemba Crime ReporterSuspected MDC-T youths have allegedly taken over parking business from City Parking and are demanding huge sums of money for bays along Nelson Mandela Avenue near the party s Harvest House head office. This comes in the wake of a recent case in which a member of the security service was allegedly assaulted by over 15 MDC-T youths near the intersection of Nelson Mandela Avenue and First Street.The incident occurred last Saturday when the member was trying to rescue a friend following an altercation with the youths.Police chief spokesperson Senior Assistant Commissioner Charity Charamba yesterday confirmed receiving such a report. The Zimbabwe Republic Police is disturbed with a case in which a member of the security service was, on 15 October, 2016, assaulted along Nelson Mandela Avenue, near First Street, she said.She said the security service member received a call from a friend who alleged that he was having an altercation with MDC-T youths.The friend had parked his vehicle and it is believed that there was a misunderstanding over an exorbitant fee he was charged by the youths for parking. He then rushed to the scene intending to rescue his friend. As he arrived at the scene, he was intercepted by around 15 rank marshals who assaulted him before he managed to escape and sought refuge at Parliament Building, Snr Asst Comm Charamba said.A report was made to the police who are still investigating the case. Police would like to strongly warn members of the public who harbour intentions of causing mayhem and disorder by attacking members of the security service. Police will not stand and watch as this behaviour is deplorable and totally unacceptable, Snr Asst Comm Charamba said.This is not the first time that members of the security service have been assaulted along Nelson Mandela Avenue, especially near the MDC-T headquarters, Harvest House.Members of the municipal police have also had running battles with vendors along that road who are known mostly for resisting arrest.In October last year, a war erupted between municipal police and what appeared to be vendors along Nelson Mandela Avenue as the vendors resisted arrest and hailed stones at the law enforcement agents.The vendors were no more than political hoodlums in the employ of the opposition party whom the party deploys as sentinels and foot soldiers of any chaotic situation near Harvest House.
