Walter Mswazie in Mapari Resort Centre, Save Valley Conservancy THE Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority has described an article entitled Armed men invade premier resort centre published by the NewsDay as malicious . The NewsDay article on October 19 alleged that there were armed men who went to the premier resort centre, some 120km along Masvingo-Mutare Road near Birchenough Bridge, where they ordered the present operator, Mr Edmore Marima, to leave the premises within six months.The article further alleged that the armed men were accompanied by Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Authority officials.Speaking during a media tour of Mapari Resort Centre, which is under the Save Valley Conservancies in Bikita District on Saturday, ZimParks Masvingo regional manager Mr Felix Chimeramombe dismissed the story as malicious and meant to peddle unwarranted falsehoods to tarnish the authority s image.He said the so-called owner of the property is actually staying at the facility in violation of the law, and his eviction was long overdue. Mr Chimeramombe said Mr Marima has not provided the authority with documentation affirming his official entitlement to the property, rendering him an illegal settler.He said it defies logic for the authority to invade its own facility when in actual fact it was granted control over it through an Act of Parliament. Out of 27 farms, the authority is running Mapari, Bedford Ranch, Humani, Senuko 2 and 3, and Impala.The proceeds are shared between the authority and communities around the facilities, which are Chiredzi and Bikita districts.The authority s regional boss said Mr Marima was riding on the original tenant, a Mr Voster, and has since lost the right to be on the premises when his boss lease was not renewed. First, I want to clarify that the property in question is under Zimbabwe National Parks and Wildlife Authority after it was handed over to us in 2014 through Cabinet. The Statutory Instrument in support of our assertion is there. NewsDay actually erred when their reporter went to the press without verifying facts on the ground.Mr Marima, that the paper claims, is the owner of Mapari Resort Centre is actually an illegal settler, said Mr Chimeramombe.He said what makes the story malicious is that the writer never bothered to seek the truth. We cannot be seen invading our own facilities, he said.
