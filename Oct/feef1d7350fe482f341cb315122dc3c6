From George Maponga in MasvingoThe Zanu-PF Masvingo Province has raised 60 cattle and over $10 000 in cash from individuals and companies as the province gears for the 16th National Annual People s Conference to be held in December. The conference will be held at the Masvingo Showgrounds along the Harare-Masvingo Highway.Speaking after a Zanu-PF Masvingo provincial co-ordinating committee (PCC) meeting held over the weekend, to assess progress in the conference preparations, Politburo member Cde Josaya Hungwe said preparations for the indaba were proceeding according to plan.Cde Hungwe said the province had already managed to surpass its target of 50 cattle to feed over 5 000 delegates expected to attend the conference. The meeting (PCC) was to assess progress for the conference and we want Masvingo to host the mother of all conferences and we will be meeting regularly as a province from now going forward because we want to hold a memorable event, he said. I am happy to announce that the chairperson of our fundraising committee, Cde Killer Zivhu, has donated 45 live beasts for the conference with Zvishavane businessman Mr Clever Pote, chipping in with a further 10 live cattle. Our Politburo member Cde Paul Mangwana has donated five beasts, he added.Cde Hungwe said that Cde Goddard Dunira, the chairperson of Vashandi Housing Cooperative in Masvingo, had donated $10 000 cash for the conference. We are very optimistic that we will meet our provincial target to raise $50 000 for the conference and besides the cash donation from Cde Dunira, we have also received pledges from Masvingo s sons and daughters in countries such as Namibia, South Africa and Botswana, said Cde Hungwe.The Zanu-PF Politburo member added that senior ruling party leaders in the province would also approach big companies such as Tongaat Hulett and Norman Richards Supermarket together with prominent business persons among them Mr Billy Rautenbach for more donations.He paid tribute to the provincial fundraising team led by Cde Zivhu for doing a sterling job in mobilising both material and financial resources for the conference. We are lucky to have a person like (Cde) Zivhu in our province, he is a God-given asset to our province because with him taking the lead, we will have the mother of all conferences. (Cde) Zivhu is the one leading all the preparations for the conference because he is a doer not a participant, there is a difference between a doer and a participant (Cde) Zivhu is a doer, said Cde Hungwe.The PCC meeting resolved to turn down a $900 donation for the conference from Zimbabwe s sole lithium producer, Bikita Minerals arguing such a big firm could not make such a paltry donation.Besides preparations for the forthcoming Zanu-PF conference, the PCC meeting also tackled thorny issues centred around land with those illegally occupying farms being advised to regularise their stay.Civil construction works at the conference venue are scheduled to start this week after the ruling party leadership in Masvingo managed to mobilise construction equipment such as front-end loaders, tippers and graders from well-wishers in the province.The ruling party has already said this year s conference will not be elective and will instead focus on coming up with resolutions to revive the economy among other pressing national challenges.Masvingo last hosted the Zanu-PF National Annual People s conference at Masvingo Teachers College in 2003.Last year s conference was held in Victoria Falls in Matabeleland North province.The province was chosen to host this year s indaba after successfully hosting 21st February Movement celebrations held every year to commemorate President Mugabe s birthday on February 27.The President s birthday celebrations were attended by a record 50 000 people.
