BERLIN. Kyle Lafferty says Northern Ireland must work their socks off in tonight s World Cup soccer qualifier against Germany as they chase a first victory over the world champions for 33 years. Lafferty scored two goals off the bench in Saturday s 4-0 win over minnows San Marino in Belfast, the same night Germany beat the Czech Republic 3-0 in Hamburg to keep their perfect record at the top of Group C.Northern Ireland are unbeaten after their two qualifiers, having also held the Czech Republic to a goalless draw in Prague last month, but Lafferty expects a tough night in Hanover. It s going to be a totally different match, said the striker, who has scored nine times in his last 11 qualifiers for Northern Ireland. We had a lot of ball and opportunities against San Marino, we ll see a lot less of the ball and we ll have to work our socks off against Germany. It s going to take a good Northern Irish performance to pull us through. It s been 33 years since Northern Ireland last beat Germany home or away. AFP.
