Morgan HeritageRenowned Jamaican group Morgan Heritage is expected in the country tomorrow ahead of their show at Harare International Conference Centre on Saturday.The group was initially scheduled to land in Harare tonight, but their flights have been changed and they will arrive tomorrow morning in separate teams. Dee Nosh of 2Kings Entertainment who are organising the show said they will receive the first team around 1am tomorrow while others will land at 930 am.He said the group is coming two days before the show to give fans assurance about the show since many other aborted attempts to bring them have created doubt around any of their advertised trips. Because of their previous advertised trips that did not materialise, many people are still doubting the trip. On Thursday morning the team will be here to tell Zimbabwe that their dream has finally come true. They are happy that they will have their first show in Zimbabwe. Many people have been asking us about the authenticity of the coming gig and we will let Morgan Heritage confirm everything as soon as they arrive, said Dee Nosh. The slight change in their flights will see the first team arriving in the early hours of Thursday. A previous announcement said they would arrive on Wednesday, but they will now land a few hours into the following day. They would have been happy to arrive earlier since they have been looking ahead to this show for many years. During the show, they will share the stage with Oliver Mtukudzi, Winky D, Freeman and popular reggae DJs.Morgan Heritage is a reggae band formed in 1994 by five children of reggae artiste Denroy Morgan, namely Peter Peetah , Una, Roy Gramps , Nakhamyah Lukes , and Memmalatel Mr. Mojo . They have had a number of successful reggae albums.Known as the royal family of reggae, the group is known for songs that include Down by the River , A Man is Still a Man , Don t Haffi Dread and She is Still Loving Me .
