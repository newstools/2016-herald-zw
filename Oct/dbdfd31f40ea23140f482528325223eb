DURBAN. South Africa and New Zealand clash today in a Rugby Championship dead rubber, but the pursuit of team and individual records should ensure an uncompromising struggle for supremacy. The Test will be played three days after All Blacks scrum-half Aaron Smith was suspended, then sent home over a Christchurch airport toilet tryst last month with a mystery woman.Tearful Smith quit Durban on Thursday having admitted he had made a huge mistake , and his absence allows TJ Perenara, who started in a win over Argentina last weekend, to retain his place. I ve made a huge mistake, a huge error in judgment, admitted Smith as he left the reigning world champions.A victory for New Zealand at Kings Park stadium in the Indian Ocean port will equal the top-tier nations world record of 17 consecutive wins. The All Blacks created the benchmark in 1969 and matched it in 2014, with South Africa equalling the feat in between. AFP.
