Bianca Leboho Herald Reporter Zimbabweans should guard against hazards related to the rainfall season, Local Government, Public Works and National Housing Minister Saviour Kasukuwere, has warned. Speaking at a Press conference to mark the International Day for Disaster Risk Reduction in Harare yesterday, Minister Kasukuwere said there was need to raise awareness of multi-hazards warning systems to reduce the tragic loss of lives. Government has made significant improvements on early warning systems for natural hazards, particularly those induced by weather conditions such as drought and flooding, said Minister Kasukuwere. Preventative programmes are being intensified and adaptation to climate change is encouraged to minimise its adverse impacts, he said. Ordinary citizens are encouraged to play their part to reduce the impact of hazards and people in homes must be educated on the necessary measures to take in case of emergency, he said.He said while the prospects for the 2016/ 17 rainy season were forecast to be better than the last season, Zimbabweans should guard against unforeseen hazards. The forecast brighter rainfall season is welcome news to all, raising hope for recovery from the El Nino-induced drought, the minister said.He said the Third World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction, which was officiated by President Mugabe as the Africa Union chairperson in Japan last year, had launched a series of themes dubbed the Sendai Seven Campaign, which sought to reduce risks and losses of lives, livelihoods and health. The Sendai Seven Targets were spread over 15 years and the IDDR 2016 addresses the first of the targets, which focuses on the substantial reduction of loss of life due to disaster. Despite advances in managing disaster risks, loss of life to predictable disaster events continue to be unacceptably high, with 700 000 people worldwide reported to have died owing to such disasters, said Minister Kasukuwere.More than 240 000 people have been affected by hazards which include malaria, dysentery and dog bites, while traffic accident front records indicate that there were 3 959 accidents with reported fatalities between the period January 2015 to February 2016, said Minister Kasukuwere.
