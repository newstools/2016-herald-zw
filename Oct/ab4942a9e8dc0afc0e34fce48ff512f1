Takudzwa Chitsiga Sports Reporter ZIMBABWE female boxer Diana Makumbe left the country for Malawi where she will fight Duduzile Kambanga of ZAMA Boxing Promotions stable on Sunday. The 34-year-old received a new boxing kit and had all her requirements for the match catered for by Law 4 All Legal Aid Society. Makumbe is hopeful she will do well in this bantamweight match after she felt cheated a fortnight ago in an encounter against Ellen Samwaka in Malawi. This is going to be a big match for me as I am also considering retiring from the sport. I have won some titles and I think age is no longer on my side so I could call it a day as I am now into music. I think I will get better treatment this time around unlike what happened the last time when I felt cheated, said Makumbe. The boxer, who is now more of the Legal 4 All Legal society ambassador, praised her sponsors and challenged female boxers to take up the sport seriously. I am glad to be going to fight with a whole set of new uniforms sponsored by a company for the first time. For the kind gesture I promise to return home victorious. I prepared for this encounter and I am confident enough to win the match, she said. Law 4 All Legal Aid Society chairman Misheck Mangwende said they will continue to support boxing. We are happy to partner Makumbe as a girl child, she has come a long way and we have been supportive of her for some time now and we will continue to do so, he said.
